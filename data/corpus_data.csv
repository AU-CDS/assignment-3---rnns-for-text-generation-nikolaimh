0,for all you americans out there  still rejoicing over the majority win of  republicans over the legislature of this landbrbewarebrjust like you would have been if  there were any other kind of majoritybrthe founding fathers had something like this in mind wheh they formed our great nationbrits part of the natural checks amp balances system that keeps this country on an even keelbrbut this is now being threatened  with the majority of executive legislative and judidical power all in the hands of one political partybrsee to it that you remember our us constitution and our bill of rightsbrremember that we are still the peoplebramerica belongs to all of usbrand god help us all
1,obamas policies may prove to be the least of this countrys worries  the gop has been emboldened to actually cut the oce in the night before the new president or congress is sworn in following in their leaders footsteps  everyone is crying foul including the gop leadership and conservative think tanks  how about a twitter regarding the swamp draining tonight
2,democrats are comprised of malcontents who generally have never worked a day in their lives and thrive on handouts from the govt fire  12 of the govt non workers and save billions trust is earned and our elected officials have not earned our trust the dont adhere to the us constitution as it restricts their movement thank goodness for the 2nd amendment and the nra or they would have already enslaved us
3,the picture in this article is the face of congressional leadership it would seem that only harry reid seemed to know that his time has passed conversely so should mitch mcconnell his times has come and gone he forces people his own age to retire while he goes on being a senatorbrbrthe senators ideas and ways of thinking are no longer mainstream he hasnt the political will or the intestinal fortitude that it will take to keep his president from running this country into the ground its time that our elected representatives have term limits imposed mitch mcconnell was raised in a white mans world where women were excluded even though he never throughly supported trump yet his wife gets a cabinet appointment the gop leadership lead by mcconnell strips down the only department that makes any real sense was the independent ethics board under the guise of how much better how much more stream line the ethics complaints will be handled essentially setting it up for their president to enrich himself as he always had and does only no ethics rules wont apply anymore more and more this isnt a country by the people and for the people no its becoming a country of the have and have nots and us being the have nots will shortly have lots lessbrbrthe democrats would be right in using  the emolument clause and the constitutional issues trump will bring against the gop offer them as much help as they offered obama and by extension us the citizens of this country
4,elections have consequences
5, shakespeare showed us that  appetite brings  its own revenge as ambition   chokes on its own excess and  consumes itself in the process 
6,obama policies are in peril as new congress takes overbrbrgod is good these days
7,im glad to hear the republicans are chomping at the bit to pass republican legislation  would that be like nixons call for for a basic minimum  income no i didnt say minimum wage i said living yearly income like nixon said  an amount that would guarantee all citizens of enough money to live modestly  or maybe it would be like gop romneycare in massachusetts that was passed long before obamacare which was in most ways modeled upon it  butoh thats right those things were put forth by another earlier republican party  sort of like the much earlier republican party that rejected slavery and wanted equality for all its citizens after the civil war
8,a typical banana republic deal
9,well mitch you havent done anything for eight years so you should be rested
10,politics what is it to gain and maintain poweror to look after the common good of the peoplebrit is 2017 and yet we are engaged in confrontations that benefit no one but or ego and selfishness it is time we work towards a betterment for all mankindbrboth republicans and democrats alike should take note and end the dogfights of selfishness
11,i am retired and medicare is an absolutely essential blessing  it has been shown to be far more cost effective than private insurance programs  for those of you who are not old enough to use it let me assure you you will be thrilled when you reach retirement age with medicare  i would also add that the only part that does not work well is the part d which is the drug part and this is because congress passed this part separately at a later date and it is run by private insurance programs like your insurance programs it has no cost control provisions and no checks on costs like allowing seniors buy imported drugs made by the same companies that sell the drugs in the us but charge far less in other countries it is by law illegal to do so  so if americans truly want useful health care wait until you are over 65 or pass a medicare like program for all  but do not let the private insurance companies andor the gop hoodwink you into dropping government run health programs while making you think private programs will be improvements
12,its a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader and we intend to do it so what were you being paid for for eight years senator slothful you should pay back every penny of your salary with interest
13,one small ray of light in the gop having full control of congress is that its all going to be on them whatever happens the gop is 100 answerable to it all they will not be able to blame anything on democrats hopefully this will show the country once and for all that supplyside economics just doesnt work and i think it will happen very quickly look for democrats to regain the senate and perhaps even up the house at midterm 
14,repeal obamacare  there are too many people getting health care and being cured   cant have thatbrbrwhy is it that people think less health care is a good thing   if it is cost sorry that is a very poor argument considering that the us has the largest gdp in the world and heath care is needed  the republicans refuse to provide health care to the people because profits are affected that is just ethically horriblebrthere is nothing the republicans have proposed that would increase the number of people receiving and the level of heath care over what obamacare has provided  and they are proud of that as are many of their constituents  any reasonable person would expect intelligent legislators to make adjustments to the current law to fix any problems and increase the numbers of people with health care
15,well maybe if obama hadnt made that infernal bargain with the clintons to keep them out of his hair for eight years and ensure they got fatter at the trough than they were already another democrat might have won and been genuinely progressive to bootbrbrthe shilling just before the election went pretty far to tarnish both of the obamas though well pretend it wasnt quite as nakedly transactional as it wasbrbrmaybe the clintons are even worse than we knew they were  maybe they had the means and intent of making life hell for obama  if notwhy didnt he have the guts to tell them to get lost  that you know elections have consequencesbrbrthey sure do
16,i will not shed a tear if some of the obama policies are in peril in the future it is not about obamas legacy it is about us and our people obviously part of the reason trump won in the heartland and rural areas of the usa was because of a  yearning for change and moving away from obama policies that failed to achieve the desired outcome in a number of ways in the home city of president obama chicago the murder rate for 2016 of 700 is unacceptable the massive loss of law enforcement personnel nationally is unacceptable the national debt is sky high the level of terrorism being unleashed by isis has reached a peak with no end in sight the epic migration of millions from the middle east to europe and north america occurred in the past 8 years after the devastation of syria yemen libya and iraq the endless longest war involving afghanistan has yet to see light at the end of the tunnel obamacare is the craziest system in the world so says none other than ex president bill clinton a career democrat in a way trump has plenty of opportunity to steer the country in a different and better direction if he can stop tweeting take a deep breath think hard about the problems and challenges he faces get the best and bold advice and steer the country in the right direction and let the press worry about obamas policies being in peril when he leaves office 
17,why do i always think of a tortoise when mcconnells visage comes to mind
18, it would be nice if we could have a return to sanity the hyperbole on both sides its not helpful i think many of us feel left out  and but politicians in washington
19,i do not understand why the senates refusal to give garrick garland a hearing has not been analyzed and on the front page of newspapers constantly perhaps daily  it is dereliction of duty and anticonstitutional in terms of the responsibilities of the senate  the fact that these elected representatives might benefit from their intransigence is galling
20,where i live we were one of the hardest hit areas by hurricane matthew  i am fortunate to live in an affluent community where i have become somewhat of a social outcast because as an hrc supporteri am considered stupid  but you should have seen them lined up at the trough asking how soon were we going to get federal money to pay for the cleanup of our community because of course we couldnt be expected to stand up on our own two feet and pay for it ourselves  but taxes are unfair and way too high  and we sure dont want government money going to the undeserving poor 
21,we are once again at the front line of whats good for republicansor the dems not whats good for the people the reality is the people dont have a say even more than ever
22,you consider equality social ills perhaps in your country it is but in the usa tell that to the regime in china sadly there will be knockings at your door
23,they should just repeal obamacare reenact it with the small corrections obama has been begging them to pass for several years and call it wonderful amazing republican healthcare  
24,i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else the house speaker paul d ryan of wisconsinbrbroh boy here we go againbrbrthe banking industry is already chomping at their collective bits for a return to the euphoria of legalized ninja loans and other creative accounting shenanigans deregulation should give them about 6 months to run up the tab into the trillions for another spate of taxpayer bailoutsbrbrits already been approvedbrbrwe can even call the next financial implosion the greatest recession
25,this is no time for hubris  you have to perform mitch mcconnell  are you sure that is a quote from the mitch mcconnell who is in the us senate i think it  must be from some other person named mitchell mcconnell  the do nothing one in the senate is not only full of hubris but will also go down as the greatest practitioner of obstructionism in us congressional history  the quote that will in fact live in infamy is our number one priority is to make this president a oneterm president  he has been arrogant disrespectful and has never failed to put party over country not once  i find him to be the single most despicable american politician of the era  although the preener paul ryan is biting at his heels for the distinction
26,enough of the 30000 foot analysis  brbrso while all of the socalled experts pundits and paid cable news contributors opine and pontificate about the congress once again voting to repeal obamacare maybe someone can write a comprehensive article about what would happen if it is repealed with no replacementbrbrmillions of people just signed up for a renewal  more signed up for the first time just within the past 6 weeks  brbrwhat do we do all you experts  beg our doctors to load us up with 90day prescriptions instead of 30 day prescriptions even if the 90day fill costs us more  or start buying from canada  insist on every test possible within the next 36 months because we wont be able to afford any tests if we dont have health insurance  have our colonoscopies earlier than planned  brbror even more significant  be so afraid of being viewed as having a preexisting condition that we dont tell our doctors whats really bothering us until its so bad that we are forced to go to the er in the middle of the nightbrbryes the premiums skyrocketed  and the plans with low premiums have high deductibles  i dont think the affordable care act works anywhere near as well as it should or could  brbrbut meanwhile millions are writing personal checks every month for this insurance and have no clue what may happen to their insurance  brbrand many of the major providers already dropped out of the exchangesbrbrhow about some advice
27,repeal and replace obamacare please
28,given that senator mitch mcconnells face is the front and center heading this article we all may want to take a moment to observe a slight clogging of swamp drain with a retread nominee yes mcconnells wife the honorable elaine l chao is trumpz nominee for her second cabinet position as secretary of commerce  she was secretary of labor in the bush administration
29,the obama regime represented eight years of social regression where people were given the sense of entitlement that they deserve to be equals where minority equals majority female equals male and other forms of social illnessesbrbrtrump may not be nationalistic in the global definition but he represents a step in the right direction
30,it would be interesting to see a pair of walls dividing america from canada and mexico and for those peoples to sit back and slowly watch america disintegrate i wonder what the bookies odds are at the momentbr i feel america deserves everything it is about receive those factory jobs have gone in all of their fields what is needed is new education to deal with a digital world and new education for those factory workers whose jobs are either being performed by robotics or sent abroad to countries that dont have unions or pollution controls 
31,i agree that mcconnel failed to do his job by not allowing hearings to replace justice scalia but still an empty seat was vastly superior to scalias rulings  with thomas on the court we have two empty seats on the scotus
32,equal rights will inevitably be set back by decades  women will likely loose further rights to their body and be thrown back to being nothing more than an incubation vessel at the pleasure of men arab persian and even indian men will be subject to further indignation as theyre all terrorists blacks will be further incarcerated at probably higher rates if not just shot dead for lunging as for the lgbt community be prepared to have your gains under obama rolled back under pence good news is that despite the injustice of the silver lining is that as a group these rights will only be put on hold  progression can not be stopped only slowedbrbrclimate change however is far more bleak we dont have time to wait and by the time we feel it its already too latebrrepublicans are not the party of lincoln havent been for the last half century they are the party of zero accountability wall street fat cats a redistribution of wealth for and towards the top 1  everyone else be damned
33,lets be honest here and nowbreven die hard liberals you cannot be happy with our failing schools loosing good jobs middle east in melt down and on an oncan youbrbe honest nowdont be like trump voters who  told pollsters no and fooled the the hillary cheerleaders
34,oh the impotent tears 
35,for all those who think obamacare is great yea its great for the 20 million who are getting subsidies a free ride is always great for those getting it but not for those paying for it many many people lost or will loose their insurance due to unaffordable increases  my brother is one  his insurance went from 300 per month to 800 because the insurance companies now have cover people whose premiums dont cover their claims let the democrats start charities to provide medicare to those who cant afford it sorry but its not the responsibility of the taxpayer to provide care for some unwed mother and her six kids or for some old person who did not save for old age 
36,im an obama supporter as painful as it is for me to see republicans planing the repeal of some of his policies we live in a democracy voters have spokenthey gave republicans the right to govern the nationbr que sera serabrbrthe majority of americans expect that  republicans and democrats in congress whose oath is to the usa and not to their party will demand that mr trump and all his nominates  reveal their tax returns before granting them the power to govern americabrbrwe need to know who they are working for
37,obamas policies are in perilnews flash the american people elected mr donald trump because as the title says obamas policies are in perilnot the policies of america that is why the democrats have in the last 8 years lost more than 1030 seats in state legislatures governors
38,looking at the us budget it is not too far off the mark to state that the us government is an insurance company that happens to field an army people on the far right please dont call these people small government conservatives would love to abolish the former and forcefeed the latter with public money until it becomes as bloated as the steroidinflated head of barry bonds circa 2001 they scream about the emasculation of the us military under president obama even though in 2015 the country led the world in defense spending at nearly 600 billion while china was a very very distant second at around 215 billion brbrdepressing that a debate about which one is more worthy of being retaineddecent social welfare provisions for nonelites versus corporate welfare for defense contractors who after 9112001 became as fat and happy as a pedpopping baseball playeris even taking place 
39,no foolish pride is not prudent but is less offensive to me than timidly winning  you won and have two years for proof dont waste even one day house and senate who face elections in two years
40,its time for mitch to retire to the elephants burial grounds maybe hell take ryan and those other neanderthals with him i hope dems have enough unity to block the destruction of obamas work especially obama care if they rename it trump care and make it better for poor and middle class people i wouldnt mind at all but im afraid they just want to destroy anything they think is progressive and promote their program of no lives matter and nobody matters except their corporate lobbyists and donors 
41,lets be clear  the gop does believe in a government safety net    they believe in a safety net for big farmers by virtue of farm subsidies  they believe in a safety net for big banks who have cheated the american people repeatedly  they believe in a safety net for big business via elimination of environmental regulations and lowering taxes  the believe in a safety net for the ultra wealthy by virtue of eliminating the capital gains tax  however they appear to not believe in a safety net for the infirm the poor the disabled the working class or even the middle class  the gops economic plans benefit those who already have massive advantages to gain wealth    mr mcconnell says you have to perform  my question to him is perform what   performance that results in poisoned water as in flint  performance that results in voter restriction as in north carolina  i cant wait to see what kind of performance occur under mcconnell and ryans leadership  
42,4 or 5 or 10 million people flooding into washington to stop trumps inauguration may give the republicans a reason to think twice about cutting social security
43,i get it that the motivation behind the aca obamacare was a good however whats stupid about the aca is that you should be able to shop around and buy full health insurance coverage from any insurer in any state regardless of where you reside and you should be able to see the medical provider of your choice regardless of any socalled network or state requirements brbrlet the carriers compete if there are no carriers who want to go into this business then the government will need to set up an insurance company or set up a system like the assigned risk pool where uninsureds can sign up and the government assigns the customer to a rotating list of carriers whether the carriers like it or notbrbri am in new york my car insurance comes from an insurance company in illinois and when i need to repair my car for an insured incident i can take it to anyone i please thats the way it should be with health insurance
44,its always funny how quickly politicians switch sides when circumstances shift the republicans now want to move ahead while the democrats want to stop things in their tracks eight years ago it was exactly the opposite brbrhypocrites all 
45,regrets are filing in via twitter via his own previous supporters this is an american issue not a party issue he has broken many campaign promises and most certainly not showing any signed knows how to heal or govern brbrhere is a link to some disgruntled former supportersbrbra hrefhttpsmobiletwittercomfreeyourmindkidlangen titlehttpsmobiletwittercomfreeyourmindkidlangen targetblankhttpsmobiletwittercomfreeyourmindkidlangena
46,obstruct obstruct obstruct 
47,why is it writers analysts and such are scrambling to  frame all around obama obamas this obamas that the policies if you will on the domestic front can more accurately and honestly be defined as the peoples policies if one looks honestly at environmental social health policies and more they were all based on doing the mostgood for the mostpeople so againanother writer wishes to shape a narrative to seemingly fit a prescribed but false angle the undoing of obama unfortunately the current angle being pushed by an increasing group of journalists is incorrectbr in these last two weeks before we enter  unknown terrain perhaps there needs be a nyt series titled  the undoing of america
48,what will the republicans replace obama care with  how will those who are depending on benefits from obamacare react when their benefits are repealed
49,amusing but sad to read comments like thisbrbrwe also know that trump knows more than the 20 plus intelligence agencies charged with gathering information on our enemiesbrbrpeople who have been complaining for years about the cia now imply we should treat everything they tell us as the gospel truthbrbrim more than willing to hear evidence of russian hacking but ive had more than my fill of unnamed intelligence officials passing on their assessments that hacking occurred time for some evidence
50,according to mitch mcconnell its a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results  it took him 8 years to realize this  dont worry mitch trump will be a one term president they need to be prepared for accept some ot the same tactics employed during the obama years democrats still have the filibuster and liberal attorney generals can file lawsuits against a president trump who will no doubt violate the constitution repeatedly
51,obamas policies are in peril because americans voted out so many members of his party  if the president didnt want his policies to end with his presidency he should have worked to make sure there were enough democrats to ensure they continued  he did not  
52,it is not only obamas policies which are being threatened but the entire progressive agenda since franklin delano roosevelt the republicans have said many times that they plan to do this and now they might have a chance hopefully there will be some in congress who can stand up to them
53,i am still earnestly trying to comprehend what modern republicanism stands for all i see and hear from its leaders is tearing down eliminating ending redundant postponing repealing redundant where is the growing adding enhancingbr the fraud amp waste song and dance wears thin like a 33 lp scratched by needles trickledown never got downbrderegulation brings competition and brings down prices has never worked yetbr the airline deregulation act of oct 1978 brought what we now have   in what is left of commercial aviationbr the breakup of ma bell in the early 1980s today looks an awful lot like it was when  telephone service  was a monopolybrso please republican voters if youre listening and reading tell me what it is that draws you to republicanism
54,the tide will turn   2018 is a door step away 
55,in trump we have a seemingly more jovial hitler typebrin other words perhaps americas first dictatorstyle of chief executive
56,its kind of like waiting for the empire strikes back
57,one can only hope that the democrats roadblocks would be modesttomoderately effective and that 2018 would be a hopeful year for democratsbrbrif much of aca amp the medicare tax for it would survive that would be great if aca is really damaged that would be disastrous for very many millions of americans 
58,nearly 50000 american lives have been saved by the aca since its implementation   brbrthe gop wants to kill the aca they dont seem to mind death panels as long as theyre calling the shots
59,trumps election actually gave the democrats a mandate to obstruct trump and the gop 247  brbrthe overwhelming popular vote for clinton demands it the majority of americans have spoken   brbrloud and clear
60,president obama brbrplease please appoint garland to scotus before you leave  it would be your last presidential gesture of hope
61,well done trump voters the guys with free excellent healthcare for life are going to repeal yours and expect you to be glad
62,nothingabsolutely nothing will change what the goprussian connection is planning for america and trumps cabinet picks also offer grave damage to our environment water air and even social security and medicare as the gop finally has their great enemy  that is average americans  finally cornered and disarmedbrbrthe gop always needs someone to hateglad im on the way out i hope ill go quickly now and not have to watch as they deliver the coup detat to the american dream for the average americans brbrso sad too badbyebye miss american pie
63, jackieall true of course but dont expect any recognition of these facts from your typical nyt commenter  the end all be all of liberals who treat this paper as the bible is that if you do not agree with them and did not vote for hrc then you  are a racist bigoted miscogynistic xenophobeno exceptions is the view as they look down their noses at the republican hoi polloi  even losing an election cant shake their social justice warrior tree  i prefer things as they are now if they refuse to change their ways to actually deign to have a conversation with the deplorables they will get re shellacked in 2018 which suits me just fine  
64,every one of the republicans in congress should watch the video of the seniors mobbing dan rostenkowski

66,with new congress poised to convene obamas policies are in peril the article headline says it all trump was elected to undo the peril of the insane obama policies thank god crone hrc was resoundly defeated let the the dismantling of obama policies and restoration of america begin the 8 year obama nightmare is coming to an end  america won will survive to fight another day
67,presidentelect trumps supporters expectbrbr1 a wall on our border with mexicobr2 expulsion of more than 11 million undocumented immigrantsbr3 the return to the us of millions of manufacturing jobsbrbrthe gop now has the absolute political power to make all these promises come true  trump voters will consider anything less to be political trickery and will be illreceived by the voters who gave president trump and congress such extraordinary control of our government  brbrtax cuts for the rich and corporations will not be considered a satisfactory substitute 
68,the democrats are so passive  if it was a democratic president coming into office with all the massive conflicts of interest that trump has the republicans would already be in court having injunctions filed and the congressional committees and special prosecutors would already be hiring their staffs
69,gop  guardians of putin pollution psychopaths greed over people wreckpublicansbrno matter how i label them there isnt anything positive this party has done for our country in the past 40 years they have pursued economic and social policies that have hollowed out the middle class pushed more people towards and over the precipice of economic ruin closed the doors to an affordable and equitable justice system exploited and expanded divisions within the country undermined our international credibility eroded our educational system put money and selfinterests ahead of the greatest good for the american people continuously worked to erode any safety nets i could go on but its all to obvious to bother i have no idea how these people can wear their american flag lapel pins and find any worth in their lives they are a sad excuse for an american political party
70,i have been listening to mitch mcconnell and the leadership of the house castigate and block our president at every turn for eight long years  they have done much harm to this country and now they must pay the piper  it is time for them to put up or shut upbrthe aca must be repealed immediately  all of president obamas illegal regulations must be repealed  taxes must be cut for industry and individuals  banks must become unregulated and free to do as they please  consumer protections must be ended  it would be good to close the departments of education health and human services and the epa   the department of energy could also be downsized let the states do what they maybrfinally we must privatize both social security and medicare so that individuals can have more freedom to do what they please with their own hard earnings and take care of their own retirements  it is these promises on which the republicans have built their house of cards  lets see them get to it
71,from the looks of the comments the drumbeat of the stolen election continues  brbrlet me remind you  democrats not only lost the presidency to republicans they lostbrbr1 the housebr2 the senatebr3 the majority of the nations governorshipsbr4  1500 state assembly seats a recordbrbrand still they are going to fight for what they perceive as right  for instance the affordable care act  except they conveniently forget that this is perhaps one of the most unpopular pieces of legislation in history and that the majority of americans opposed it  that cognitive dissonance  which continues today  is why they lost so resoundly in this election
72,all you americans out there thinking we won just because the gop is now in charge of the congress presidency and probably the supreme court have you actually considered how incredibly onedimensional that kind of government isbrand how similar it is to a dictatorship  or even that kind of government which is currently found in putins russiabrits time to realize this country is tilting so far in one direction that its in danger of capsizing altogetherbrunless that is what you wantbrthen there will be no winners
73,the electorate stopped w from privatizing ss so i hope they will see the terrible consequences of eliminating the aca the mid terms are only 2 years away and 2 years is more than enough time to see the dangers of having republicans in charge 
74,a heritage plan first put into the real world by a republican governor is now a socialist plot to destroy our countrybrjust like deficits in government is horrible unless the gop does it
75,i think the republicans deserve every bit of cooperation they gave obama and the democrats over the past 8 years
76,this headline with new congress poised to convene obamas policies are in peril focusses on the least important thingbrpolicies dont suffer obama wont suffer its the american people who are in peril from the new congress eg at risk of losing healthcarebrso perhaps a better headline is with new congress poised to convene millions of americans in peril some will die
77,everyone who loses their obamacare coverage needs to line up on the sidewalks for blocks around their local public hospitals holding signs saying lost my obamacare  i cant afford private health insurance i have a preexisting condition etc  tv news loves that kind of thing come to think of it dont wait for the axe to fall do it on january 21st so president trump and republicans in congress can get the message before they mess with 20 million american voters health insurance aka their lives of course they wont do a full repeal right out of the gate theyre not stupid so you have to keep showing up every week although i have medicare ill stand with the younger working people because my children are affected if people all over the country did this on the same day we will be heard
78,this is certainly an outcome that is devoutly to be wished for  the only question is whether they can start today rather than tomorrow
79,the only thing clear is that republicans refuse to listen to fact reason truth science and logic and refuse to believe what they see with their own eyes and hear with their own earsbrbrthey know this man they voted for is not a good business man  he is a liar and a cheat and a contract breaker they know he is a serial cheater on his vows to his wives  publicly and without shame  they know what he thinks about women  from his own mouth not just once but a public broadcast history they know how mean spirited he is toward gold star families and latina beauty queens and high school girls and real tortured military heroes and in his recent new years tweet to us allbrbrthey excuse him and explain him and translate him  our great communicator  while he runs roughshod over politeness and courtesy and class and grace and calls his crude meanness a lack of political correctness  while my father who was born in 01 and fought at age 16 in the great war would have slapped him across the face for the words he uses the crudeness he displays and he would have thrown him  bodily  from the porch of our homebrbri know a good and gracious man when i see one  one is leaving the white house  and one should never get close to its shadow
80,already sick of hearing trump supporters blaming obama for the impending disaster that is the trump presidency  its not obamas faultits yoursbrjust like its your fault and not the federal governments that red states arent progressing at the rate that blue states are economically  its because of the people who live in those states that they are the worst part of the country not obamas  its what you voted for thanks to all that talk radio and right wing propaganda youve swallowed
81,from now on senator schumer and democrats in congress should let republicans know that they will not be collaborating with a trumpbradministration unless mr trump and all his nominates show their tax returnsbrunlike republicans with mr obama democrats will have a valid reason not to work with mr trumpbrbrdemocrats have to learn to play hardball
82,this would stand to reason the american voters chose a change of leadership and a change in some policies this is a result of the democratic process  i hope that you do not oppose that 
83,constantly these references here about putin the questionable capabilities of trump and now what the senate and congress will do are getting old  time will tell  first focus on the democrats who messed up by proposing hillary clinton thus causing several million voters to pass or switch over to the republicans  that is the real issue but not touched with a tenfoot pole  new york times please do your job
84,now that we finally have a smart guy as president we know he will do the right thing by supporting the republican repeal of all that obama has done for the average american this will mean more money for the white middle class and less bureaucracy to deal with in getting that money we also know that he knows more than the 20 plus intelligence agencies charged with gathering information on our enemies what bothers me about that prospect is that the only way you can know more about the russian hack than the cia or fbi is to have information from the hackers themselves
85,the good is that obamas policies are in peril the bad is the kind of peril they are in unfortunately two bads dont make a good
86,both the republicans and democrats are in for a shock with trump clearly trump will remove the epa bunch and other regulations but the other so called republican proposals no one will do that
87,maybe in their bubble they think they can do whatever they wish  let them  they will find the consequences to be rather instructive but not in a way they can possibly imagine  
88,once again this paper designs to shape and distort the truth of what the gop intends  is it possible for one example of this most obvious repeating fact that what the nyt deems negative is actually positive  is it possible that refashioning the social safety net will actually save tens of thousands of people from a lifetime dependency  which is the democrat intention  how else could they ever hope to win an election  by the way its not the congress that threatens the obama legacy  its the record itself  under a cleaner light  
89,obama knew he was never qualified to be a president but he still signed up for itbrbrhe ended up blaming his failures on republicans or racism he managed to botch obamacare even with sc supporting itbrbrhillary would have been a far better and successful president than obama  dnc failed us in 2008 and again in 2016 for different reasons
90,when they break theyll own it i can imagine the red state governors explaining to their working class white constituents why they no longer have health care insurance and why coal is no longer king and why the wall isnt being built and why their savings evaporated in another wall st scambrbrthe entire midwest will resemble atlantic city in a few short years and the saps who bought into the carnival barkers promises will blame everyone else for their predicament
91,its so difficult for me to understand how attacking healthcare connects with the every day working class voter the gop tries to paint it as evil incarnate despite millions of americans benefitting and more sign ups than ever this year  even with the higher rates trying to build up this passionate hatred for something that benefits so many is going to be a sticky move i really think its a massive mistake on the part of the gop 
92,one of the ideas being floated by republicans regarding the repeal of aca is expanding health insurance currently offered to federal employees very good with many options and continuing the acas provisions for preexisting conditions and dependent child healthcare  it would be interesting if the times covered some of those alternative scenarios
93,are obamas achievements in peril or is it that democracy is not working well there are three main policies in the article health taxes and environment  the point is i if the new congress supports the policies that favor the rich and attacks the programs that favor the not so rich  i do not think it will happen so easily  if it becomes reality we can start to think how we can make democracy work under new political parameters
94,a sitting presidents policies may be in peril as a new administration prepares to take the job its almost as though its not even fair anymore that some people  maligned all year by the continual adherence to silliness this headline upholds  elected a new person 
95,the main criteria for considering altering or repealing a program should be whether it is beneficial or not and if it is popular the republicans care about 2 things first is it obamas and second does it comply with their ideology not very objective are they
96,undoubtedly dt and his cabinet are enjoying their plans to increase their fortunes and power over the electorate we can only hope that the media will give up equal time and inform the majority of americans of what the oligarchs are doing and that there are enough public schools and universities left to teach political science and civicsbrbrit is time to reveal the stories of the koch brothers along with those of the proposed cabinet to the citizenry of the country they plan to rule
97,the gop is poised yet to promote unregulated supplyside economics which will fail systemically for america with no hope for economic recovery     brbrinvestment bankers control the wealth in america they manage huge stock portfolios with influential proportional ownership shares in many american corporations in our global economy to keep returns high for their investors the companies keep wages and benefits low and prices high this is the main reason why trickledown economics today does not work for middleclass america and will continue to failbrbryet the gop and trump favor supplyside economics
98,destroying the progress weve made on reducing co2 emissions is a crime against humanity  we will all face catastrophic climate change if we continue on the business as usual path of burning fossil fuels  is shortterm profit worth devastating climate disaster  apparently the exxonfunded republican party believes so   their grandchildren will not be so thrilled about it  brbrthe incoming climate change denying administration is poised to destroy our childrens futures  
99,the rich republicans never care if the poor live or dieeverything is bad choices and the fault of those they toy with emotionally and with healthcare physically all republicans the preponderance is close enough are only interested in maintaining and retaining their powerthey already have the money paul ryan is the head turncoat but how anyone can respect the position of speaker of the house after newt gingrich and dennis the rank and file pedophile hasstert is beyond mebut no one cares about truth anymore you have an uber indolent president elect who skips the very intelligence briefings he is now whining about not having seen evidence of the russian hackingwhat a baby put barron in chargethough he looks a bit lost too like father like son 
100,in my 71 years this is the most depressing anticipation of a new president i can recall  it seems like the evil empire is winning and they are going to usher in an era of repression and punishment of all but the top 1  good bye compassion and consideration and hello greed and revenge on democratic programs enacted to benefit masses of people  rip social security and medicare along with the affordable care act  
101,if the potential damage this demented sociopath can wreck on society is to be avoided the democrats need to completely reevaluate going forward  as long as trump retains the maniacal support of a lot of uninformed ignorant followers many of whom are racists etc but many of whom just do not have the intellectual capacity or in many cases the interest to evaluate anything he might do it will not be enough to present facts or truth or logic   an all out pr campaign will be necessary an assault such as has never been done unrelenting brbrwe need the very best of the entertainment industry to put together information which is easily understood and irrefutable  we are dealing with a pathological liar a con man who has fooled half the nation  and a public who loved being fooled  msm needs to give back what they gave to trump  his followers are impervious to facts  so we need to mount a propaganda campaign which is vicious as he is  
102,the democrats have been nice for far too long they should obstruct trump i will never call him president at every turn as the republicans did to obama the democrats have patriotic duty to do this the republicans clearly only care about party not country why else would they support a man who cares more about russias leader than the fact that the email server of the dnc containing the emails of an american presidential candidate was hacked by russians and probably putin trumps election team transition team and candidates for his cabinet have far too many connections to russia and putin these connections make me nervous is trump a russian puppet and if he isnt why cant we see where his business interests are  transparency would be trumps best defence against allegations if there is in fact no connections to russia but alas no transparency seems coming now or any time soon  but until trump proves to us he has not been not compromised by his russian interests i will assume he is so democrats obstruct away
103,republicans have been imperiling the nation for decades now they are in a good position to outdo themselves i have no doubt they will sink to the occasion 
104,the headline is misleading  it is not a problem for obama he is satisfied that he did good for the country  it is rather that we the citizens of the united states are poised for peril as the republicans and particularly mcconnell are going to make things sad for the weakest people in our country  obamas legacy will not disappear  he is in a class by himself having done his best in the face of an opposition congress that would not give anything good to the american peoplebrwe must fight the republicans to allow all americans to have a safe sane and good life
105,whatever health insurance changes the republicans make to the affordable care act they should require that the changes apply to all members of congress and their staffs and require that they all obtain health insurance coverage through the method they are offering to all americans to get their health insurance  see how their staffs react     
106,the current brand of republicans beholden to billionaires and bible thumpers have acted as americas worst enemy for over a generation  i consider them as treasonous to average americans  they deserve nothing but contempt
107,the third railbrbrmaybe notbrbruntil 2000 the outlook was always upwards and onwardsbrbrtoday even the elderly know they have been taking the cream and their children and grandchildren are going to get stuck with the restbrbrin a vote today probably 90 percent of workers under 40 would be willing to give up what they have paid in just to be done with itbrbranyway the republicans did not need the vote to winbrbrnothing is guaranteed
108,this republican led country now is going to be a breath of fresh air there is so much cleaning up to do after the last 8 years of unwanted progressive policies its a big task at hand but i am so grateful that we have the right people in place to get us back in the game
109,of course obamas policies are at risk  as obama himself said elections have consequences  not just presidential elections but elections for the house and senate
110,as someone with a son who has cystic fibrosis and is willing to pay for insurance prior to obamacare we could not get on any planbrbrbefore the republicans pontificate on repealing the aca  i sure hope they step up with a plan that honors trumps directive to keep portions of the aca that continue to accept folks with preexisting conditionsbrbrotherwise please sit down and keep quiet until you have something worth talking about
111,if republicans want to repeal obamacare its only fair that we as voters ask congress to sacrifice their government paid for health benefits think of all the tax dollars we would save if all government workers had to pay for their own private health insurance i wonder how many trump voters have health insurance thru state or federal government paid for by our tax dollars i want them to think of how lucky they are and then think about others who dont have that luxury 
112,i believe we will see how serious the gop is about governing with investigations into trumps many conflicts of interests some of which are unconstitutional as well as illegalbrthe overunder number is 05
113,perhaps had the democrats allowed some of the amendments from the gop with respect to affordable care act thereby having some bipartisanship built in then there would be a slight chance for not a complete repeal i remember then the senate majority and house using parliamentary procedures to ram through acc legislature and get it passed that way circumventing any amendments proposed by gop now it is come back to bite democrats nancy pelosi and harry reid share significant amount of blame for this fiasco 
114,sadly for better or for worse we will heretofore be victim to a one party system  in this new america if the congress and the presidency are not controlled by the same party there is nothing but stonewalling and gridlock as each would bite off their nose to spite their face rather than do anything that might make the other party look good  and so it will be until the divisions are met with fruitful thought and meaningful compromise that the pendulum shall swing back and forth
115,obama ruined his own legacy he never wanted to work with republicans and basically told them to shut up and sit down he floated and   told the republicans that  elections have consequences and i won many of these republicans worked with clinton  but obama contempt for them and lack of political skills made that impossible  he earned their contempt and obama are passed without a single republican vote and threatened them with his phone and pen now his legacy  is in jeopardy  he has no one to blame but himself 
116,as the exit polls have definitively shown bernie would have crushed trump in the rust belt and taken the election easily the great irony for obama is that goldman sachs prevented that with a strategy of hugging obama to hillarys breast throughout the primaries in their campaign to con black voters into believing the lie that hillary cared more for them than bernie so that successful strategy for getting the most despised nominee in the partys history nominated is now about to obliterate obamas legacy and achieve the goal of trump and his obamahating voters make it like obama never even happened as if you were restoring a house from an invasion of mold historians will now have little choice but to see obama as a blip only slightly more consequential because of his race than jimmy carter a bitter pill for both obama and his black voters to accept too bad those blacks did it to themselves bernie would have preserved obamas legacy built on it and honored obama very sincerely 
117,my life and friends life have changed not at all because of either obama or trump i do see though some very rich politicians on both sides of the isle rich bankers lawyers doctors ceos wall street types oh yes and dont forget some tv journalistsart dealers and others over the past 25 years normal folks i dont see many rich fireman police officers military personnel nurses sanitation workers teachers students among the majority this drama of the us government is played and replayed while the real show is being played in the background if the government cant improve regular folks out there this go round then both sides are laughable failures so within about 9 months the verdict should come in as the democrats line up to fight back with every step the right takes is that really what they want their legacy to the next generation to be if they are so preprogrammed to fight whatever is put in front of them they should not be getting their fat salaries and cadillac health care policies and free gas credit cards so fast i wont rush to vote democrat anytime soon again watching this unfold if the nyt is right for once
118,ive noticed a subtle shift in elite attitudes toward trumps electionbrbrmany still blame putin or comey or the electoral college or a myriad of other causes and this undoubtedly will continue but most people seem to get the point clinton lost and trump won because most americans are not doing well and are tired of being told that they are brbrthe new elite tack seems to be ok we get that message but when trump supporters learn that he cant solve their problems theyll drop him like a hot rockbrbri do expect that trump will fail to change much americans are losing jobs more because of automation than cheap foreign labor for example and erecting tariff barriers wont change that nor will us consumers like paying 8 for items theyve been paying 3 for just so they can say i bought american that will get old really fastbrbrthe big question for democrats though will remain brbrwho will benefit from trump supporters inevitable disillusionment brbrmany democrats assume voters will abandon trump and the republicans when they stumble and that they the democrats will inevitably benefit thats not so clear to me trump and the republicans will blame any failures on the democrats if the democrats have nothing to say other than the republicans havent solved your problems so vote for us i think most voters will accept the republicans version of events brbrthe democrats need a new positive narrative or things will get worse for them not better
119,start by writing your senators to oppose the following 8 trump nominations to is cabinet  there are plenty of problems with each of thembrbrsenator jeff sessions of alabama to serve as attorney general  was nominated for a judgeship and rejected by the senate on charges of racism the southern poverty law centers heidi beirich who tracks hate speech reported  that sessions is guilty of it and that his mere presence in trumps inner circle is a tragedy for american politicsbrbrexxon mobil ceo rex tillerson as secretary of state   lets see his tax returns and what are his business ties to putinbrbrrep mick mulvaney rsouth carolina a spending hawk selected to be director of the office of management and budget brbrbetty devos an advocate of charter schools who is chosen to be secretary of education brbrprice rgeorgia the antiaffordable care act champion chosen to be secretary of health and human services brbrandrew puzder the fast food ceo chosen to head the department of labor brbrsteve mnuchin the former goldman sachs executive picked to head the treasury departmentbrbr scott pruitt the oklahoma attorney general who opposes many existing environmental regulations who is the choice to head the environmental protection agencybrbrformer texas governor rick perry to run the department of energy an agency perry proposed to abolish in 2011
120,why must it all go around in endless cycles  both parties have lost their wits nobody seems to understand that both political parties hardly deserve any compassion clintonitesthe country has suffered enough of them republicans have dishonoured the name of honest abe himselfbrdecent people who deserve better for themselves russians suffer from an acute inferiority complex more insight into russian history is needed before we reiterate the usual condemnations  in any event there is too much rehashing and recycling shell shock is quite debilitating  so it wont be easy but we must somehow survive too many americans have hit the panic button in the process we cannot see the forest or the trees  
121,with the entire republican party in lockstep to disembowel the constitution the bill of rights regulations on banking the environment and turning it into mike pences dream of a theocracy it is for all intents and purposes a crime family they have stolen their paychecks when you consider they have not done any work for the pay in eight yearsbrbrand speaking of congressional paychecks the divisiveness brought to us by republican strategists such as karl rove and frank luntz the thought occurs to me why not change the rules on how they are payed let each state pay the salaries of their senators and members of the house the idea that my tax dollars are paying the salaries of mitch mcconnell and his goon squad and for paul ryan the faux numbers guy and his equally unqualified gang of tinybrained folk representing tinybrained congressional districts brbras wc fields said in a movie and i paraphrase slightly  throw them overboard and let the sharks take care of themselvesbrbras for trumps cabinet selections as one as completely uninformed as he there should be little doubt that the current appointees were selected by reince priebus and mike pence trump is just their rubber stamp to dismantle a great country
122,affordable care act is affordable to every us citizen no oxymoron here but every one has to pitch in even a tiny bit no free ride many of the people afflicted with addiction are very thankful that they can be treated through aca and be able to move on with their lives my modest but adequate coverage is within my budget keep myself healthy it is not a perfect law but it works i am a pragmatist
123,of course they are at risk the right has won every branch of government trump is not really an ideologue i dont know what he is  well see but he leans right in many areas and congress is right wing soon the supreme court will tilt right again the left can pretend that obamas policies are the norm and moderate and that trump is an extremist but such a counterfactual perspective is what helped trump get elected what do you think the left will try and do if they win the next one  continue trumps policies of course not
124,the president and every legislator with any regard for the quality of life spoiled by mountaintop removal mining have to consider the permanent damage to the air and water that will be contaminated by the spill from the shearing of soil and rocks not to mention the destruction of a priceless homeland brbrthe question for the workers is if the jobs while so important are worth the destruction of their way of life as towns lose its population
125,those of us who did not vote for trump should recognize that the republican partys and trumps stranglehold of support from the white working class has more to with wwc tribal loyalty and very little on wwc economic security  brbrthe wwc are contemptuous of elite liberals ie members a nonwwc tribe who supposedly look with condescension on real americans a ridiculous myth that has not been challenged forcefully enough  but the wwc are very dependent on the aca medicare medicaid and social security  in other words because of tribal loyalty the wwc vote against their own interestsbrbrmy question is this  if recipients of those programs dont vote to defend them why should anyone else care
126,brace yourselves republicans now have the power to invoke their economic policy en masse you know the one  and try to prove that it always was an honest way to create jobs and allow the lower levels of the income disparity to catch up and not just a ruse that enriches the upper levels of income alone  if it doesnt work this time the only explanation is that it was always a scam that pulled the wool over the eyes of their faithful followers while the money ran to offshore havens  the plan for its completion still has to be accepted by the people who tell payroll departments what to do with the revenue  that part of the plan has always been out of reach of legislation  i guess that means that the plan never really was valid 
127,oh now i see  its a death panel
128,when you get to the downside of getting rid of obamas legacy write an article about it18 more days
129,oh really i wonder what gave you that impression
130,in a country where corporations are people people will have no choice but to become corporations i only halfjokingly suggest that you should change your name to morgan stanley its conveniently gender neutral just look at how pathetically obsequious and groveling gop members of congress behaved awhile back when jp morgan ceo jamie dimon testified before them do you really think ryan mcconnell amp co would ever behave in a manner so servile and deferential before a nonrich person trumps billionaire cabinet nominees are going to sail through senate confirmation hearingsbrbrbeginning tomorrow all individuals must ask themselves what would morgan stanley do answer is obviously prioritize me myself and i twentyfour hours a day when people who view you as nothing more than a source of wealth extraction are going to try and put their ideas into practice you are morally obligated to fight back rather than roll over let the battles begin 
131,gop planbrevery year if you pay taxes you will receive a voucher for your childrens education your familys heath care and your retirement benefits  then you will step into the private market and plan your yearbrgood luck
132,have yet to see any trump acolytes jump in here and say finally someone in charge who will take away my social security and medicare or ss and medicare have been far too generous for me and my friends we want it rolled way backbryou do know thats what you voted for or was it the reopening of the coal mines  or was it that you wanted a return to the good old days of allamerican poisoned air water and food  cause thats also what you voted for
133,if you like the idea of dismantling medicare or losing your health insurance then these have to be exciting times for you or if you dont care much about clean air and clean water and you like major fossil fuel investors like icahn advising our next president on rolling back environmental protections very exciting or if you have faith that the strong presence of wall street in our new presidents cabinet will be there to look out for americas poor and middle class the good times are here if you like the idea of trade tariffs and ripping up nafta and dont care much about inflation or even a recession then youre thrilled at what lies aheadbrbror if youre anxiously waiting to nail down a job cleaning hotel rooms or picking vegetables in the fields you big moment of opportunity is coming as soon as the deportations beginbrbrand if you trust putin and like the idea of a weakened nato and enjoy increased russian aggression across the globe your moment in the sun is almost here
134,the fbi has a long track record of interfering in our national and state politics as if they were above all from watergate to abscam to director comey throwing the election its time to abolish the fbi which is the political wing of the pentagonbrbrdemocrats when you get back in power destroy the fbi
135,i hope the democrats are the gops worst nightmare they should throw monkey wrenches into every bad idea they come up withbrbrfrankly i think democrats have been too nice for far too long time to get toughparticularly with trump get under his skingive no quarterdare him to tweet so his base will see him for what he isbrbrand for gods sake trip him whenever they can nothing less will do trump has proved over and over ad nauseam that hes simply not a nice guybrbrtheres only one way to deal with a notnice guy make his life as difficult as possible dont let him off the hook and get him to lose his cool so the us public will see the real donald not the phony persona he tries to cultivate
136,what republicans did to president obama starting on january 20 2009 congressional democrats must do to republicans starting on january 3 2017  fight them at every turn and with every parlimentary tool available and give them not a single inch on anything  if any part of the republican agenda no matter how small passes congress anyway it must not be with one single solitary democratic vote  fight them
137,cant say that id blame the republicans if they really do tear apart obamas perceived legacy  obama and his fellow democrats did more damage to this nation and to the world in eight years than gw bush clinton ghw bush and reagan did in all their combined years
138,yes they are laws and policies enacted during obamas term but they are also policies a majority of americans support some by a supermajority margin so lets call them policies for americans that the american taliban want to eliminate
139,the reek of gop retribution is pungent indicating the first 100 days of the new administration will be vindictive not healing now is the quiet before the storm seat belts on
140,for all thats written or said it seems were on our way to watch four years of ustornapart crisis just as we used to watch the greek crisis  the endless makingof of an endless daily catastrophe 
141,let them repeal all that obama did it only shows how dangerous a one party system can be and that its all about party politics not the common good in any event thanks to trump obama will be know as americas last great president6
142,the republicans were very wise to wait until after the election to propose a supreme court justice nominee to replace antonin scalia and reject obamas pick  justice scalia must have been looking out for them from above and is having a good laugh  this is great news for the conservatives who will choose someone who is not a progressive liberal but will follow the constitution as was intended  they will bring back normalcy and stop all the leftwing nonsense and mischief that has been created by the democrats  it will be a new dawn and a new day  it is just too good to be true 
143,2 years from now cant get here fast enough 
144,everything good and decent about this nation is under attack time to start thinking in terms of trump friends and enemies 
145, given the circumstances benjamin disraelis advise to to hope for the best but prepare for the worst seems to me to be overall  wisest  course of action anyone in the democratic party could hope for knowing however that the democrats faced  very similar circumstances as a result of the 2000 general electionswith not only the election of george w bush to the white house but also the taking of both the house and the senate by the gop i would hasten to remind the democrats that disraeli when hotly pressed by a powerful opposition also said to their chest beating leader finality sir is not the language of politics  cheers
146,oh please nyt when will you write an article about president trump that is other than from a negative point of view when president obama before his acceding to the presidency criticized the policies of president bush and said he would end the war in iraq and pull out of afghanistan your reporting supported the incoming president even to the point of his inheriting a weakening economy nyt bought hope and change through eight years of president obama even in a total absence of any hope promised to bring harmony in washington when will the nyt report the state of divisiveness that has resulted from president obamas turning away from the black community of the us when will the nyt report on the causes of the monumental increase in our national debt under the president obama administration when will the negative side of the last eight years be reported by the nytbri am weary of reading the allnegative reporting about our next president in over 70 years of reading the nyt i can never recall such a campaign by the nyt attempting to degrade an incoming president      
147,we in the blue states must stay on our state and federal representatives to keep our laws fair and inclusive we had to really depend on federalism now  ironically states rights must be powerful we can use their weapons against them now our enemies as trump named us
148,had president obama not dragged this nation so far left we would not have a donald trump dragging us so far to the right it is simple newtonian politics of actionreaction
149,why is america fixating on putins intervention into american politics why shouldnt he we would do the same and the new information technology has made it possible for putin to interfere in the american election at minimal cost russia is a poor countryalmost a third world country long suffering from a total inferiority complexitself beyond reason american foreign policy operates in a world of illusion perhaps delusion one has to know ones enemy thats the primary truth  history teachesitself a question americans know very little about the real russiaas opposed to the ideological near mythological russia of their dream world americans better study their russian history with more insight if they wish to figure out how they should deal with russia otherwise past blunders will only repeat themselves endlessly americans tend to live in a fantasy world so over computerized that any person with any sanity left in him is quite likely to lose it and the world has moved far beyond orwell now and trump has arrived wearing armor forged in hell why is anybody surprisedyet everybody seems to be i dont understand it is all at least interesting
150,were looking at four years of mean spirited dark deregulatory legislation that will take 20 years to undo  the party of fear and loathing is now in charge and were all about to suffer the consequences these people do not know good governance but they do know how to rob a country blind 
151,if the republicans giddy with their new power choose to move quickly slashing the affordable care act and gutting medicare theyll be in for a surprise there will be roars heard outside their chambers and blood in the hallways because in fact they will have slashed and gutted the lives of their constituents many of whom rely on these government programs many of whom voted for donald trump many of whom watch their budgets carefully and are not fools
152,our country had swung too far to the left and people were tired of it obamacare put a bitter taste in peoples mouths we need less government micromanaging of our daily lives and it looks like republicans are going to deliver theyd better that is kind of why we elected donald trump
153,my nightly prayers now include a plea to protect us from republicans and conservatives
154,the policies may be repealed but the greatness of the man who instituted them will only grow
155,obamacare is such a golden gift to the insurance industry it will be interesting to see how much the gop really try to meddle with it do they hate obama so much that they will cut back on their corporate sponsors
156,when all is said and done or undone will putin be able to notice a gainful difference between interference and otherwise just having let the thing collapse on its own demerits
157,trumps first act will be to pardon himself and his children his second act will be to renegotiate all of his contracts with himself what was known as the usa and will be known going forward be just a part of the trump organization
158,mitch mcconnell and the rest of the senate refused for year to hold hearings for the presidents scotus appointment  that in its self is a treasonous act  congress is going to gut medicare and cut social security  trump is going to give himself and all of his billionaire buddies huge tax cuts while the rest of us slog through another gop stalled economy  remember the last time the gop controlled all three branches of government we were saddled with two wars the largest deficit this country has ever had and a financial collapse close to a depression  i for one do not want to repeat this life experience    
159,or maybe better let the republicans do all they want starting with social security and medicare  it certainly would help me  and see how their constituanct likes it
160,who is going to be hurt the most the welfare states that voted for trump who is going to gain the most  trump and putin is the swamp being drained it sure is the swap creatures are now everywhere growing bigger and eating everything and everybody our only hope is that they eat each other until they are all gone and gone
161,americas democracy at work we voted for them now we have to live with the consequences
162,didnt mcconnell signal to the voters of kentucky that he would fix rather than repeal the aca in his last senate race in order to secure a winbrbri mean the aca has worked very well in kentucky although if you call it obamacare instead of the aca it polls differently some people do not seem to know all the aspects of the aca or that it is all the same thingbrbrso how is he going to deal with thisbrbrwill he lie like ryan and say that it is bad for medicare or bad for deficits and debtbrbrnot only did the aca extend the life of medicare but while the gop in the house were trying to repeal the aca the cbo sent both boehner and ryan letters saying a repeal would actually add 109 billion to deficits and debtbrbra hrefhttpswwwcbogovpublication43471 titlehttpswwwcbogovpublication43471 targetblankhttpswwwcbogovpublication43471abrbrso how will he justify this
163,the most despicable thing about the altrepublican congress is their obvious underlying contempt for citizenship which belies paul ryans hilarious claim that they were given a mandate by the peopleminus 3 million to effectively disempower their citizenship the bill of rights and much morebrbrthis is not a call to arms for all americansnot yetbut it is a call to service we must take aim at these ghastly excuses for humans and their piracy of every noble right we are entitled to ghastly men and women the lot of them
164,those in washington are there to represent the citizens of our country however i see very little of note for that purpose instead they do what benefits them such as salary so long as they live and noteriety sp they dont fool me they got there for themselves and for fame now its red hat who wants to destroy what we do have ugh
165,trumps questions on every bill will be where is the clause that excludes trump and his children from all regulations just like the house and senate exclude themselves and where does it say what trump and his children get the rest does not matter as long as there is nothing good for trumps enemies enemies means everyone who does not praise trump and who has said anything against trump 
166,mean spirited white republicans will veer america to its limits in term of relations between its citizens and the outcome will not be very pretty they want to bring america to the 50s in an era where only english and whiteness were the norm look at the photo of the old man from kentucky and every other nominees that will rule america at the top a grifter and liar in chief 
167,the democratic party no longer believes in democracy except of course in california which somehow knows better than the rest of the country if they had their druthers obama would be presidentforlife if only philosophers could be kings and every king as wise as obama then it would be a perfect world in which the constitution or the rule of law would no longer be necessary but the judgment of the benevolent one would be the final word so we bid you goodby obama with a wistful sense of what might have been phewww what a relief
168,now why would certain republicans on one hand scorn trump for acting out his various evils and yet still support his nomination what would they have to gainbrbrit is pretty much accepted that trump in office would create an economic and global catastrophe big money would lose big in some cases everything but unless big money has control of this country which it does via the bought and paid for republican party big money would be certain to lose certain amounts of money if the democrats come into control of the us government also having control of the presidency would have a trickle down affect for other key positions in our government such as the supreme courtbrbrso first of all it is imperative that the republicans acquire and maintain control of the us government since the only real chance of doing that is to support trumpso be it act all disgusted with trump but underneath take actions that would continue to put trump into office but to leave trump in office will lead to the inevitable collapse of the known world so trump would have to go awaysomehow with trump on a permanent hiatus that would then leave the next in line for the presidency and of course that would be whoever is in the vice president slotpence president pence pence has already shown his support for koch like governmentbrtrump would need to take the presidency but go on vacation before he had made any decisions on who to put into those support officesscotusbrbrno trump 
169,obamacare looked great on paper but in reality it was a failure for many americans who were promised excellent healthcare at affordable prices  what happened was just the opposite  health insurance companies have opted out and the cost of the premiums have skyrocketed  in addition those covered lost their doctors and in return received inferior health care  brbrthere will be coverage under the republicans but more equitable  why should some americans get their healthcare for free or next to nothing while others are paying exorbitant prices  the democrats believe in handouts which do not work as is shown by this failed system  good bye obama and obamacare  hello republicans and prosperity for all
170,the hatred of obama by the right is a pathology  a sickness unemployment in the us is falling and is nearly half that of europe also below australia and canada gdp growth is up and is  above canada australia france germany the uk the us has weathered the crash better than anyone would have guessed but no hes black hes rational hes educated and sensible all things the right cant bear so lets pretend america is screwed and lets elect a transgressive narcissist with the attention span of a tweet in hock to a russian mussolini like thatll end well odds on trump not serve his term are only 21 already before he starts obama well miss you in fact please ignore precedent stick around and show trump up for what he is
171,just one example of an exploitation of taxpayers that probably will not be corrected by republicans  medicare rules do not allow any medicare coverage for 500000 over 65 eligible american expatriates living overseas around the worldbrbrthese taxpayers do not receive their normal medicare coverage because of this arbitrary overseas rule that clearly represents taxation without representationbrbrthese uncovered americans are forced to purchase unnecessary private health insurance despite having already paid for their medicare through their taxes
172,the progressives had better radically step up their game because if they keep being such pathetic sore losers they will be utterly crushed in the 2018 midterms i see no recognition among the smug arrogant condescending progressives that they lost the 2016 election for a reason
173,i dont believe in cozying up to goldman sachs lack of competence and honesty in government bad trade deals and rising death tolls in black ghettos as a ralph nader progressive i could not vote for hillary clinton and the democratic party that supports that supports or overlooks these issues i didnt vote for donald trump but the democrats will never prevail if they continue in their plutocratic falsepopulist ways where is ralph nader when we need him
174,salted by evidence of russian electoral interference is a resonant phrase and one which the times repeats more than any other newspaper of record  the only problem is there is no evidence at least no evidence the times has produced and none that the us intelligence agencies hardly immune from political interference of their own have shared with the american people  until and unless they do  and the excuse that its all too likely to lead to disclosures of our own methods etc  the charge will wear exceedingly thin something which is already happening  its a convenient charge for the democrats to help explain their electoral disaster and tar trump with disloyalty and contempt for the democratic process  but if the consequences are that grave why has obamas reaction been so timid and limited  kicking out 35 russian reps and closing what have been called spy housing  please  virtually all the evidence to date thats been produced are the names of officials in russian intelligence and their agencies missions  this is the kind of stuff any one can get from google or the rolodex of any of our own spooks  this is beginning to look very embarrassing and methinks that the real villain may not be the evil donald but the mildmannered no drama obama
175,medical care is a business and profitable industry it does not matter what party will regulate it   medical care is based on profitable business model with the goal to sell services and to make a profit not to produce health people like itbrlosers and poor do not deserve medical care  clear message from gop   
176,it seems that all republican policies are based on dismantling any semblance of effective governance  if they really had the courage of their convictions they would be anarchists  but really they just want a new system which only favors them
177,but is there really anything unique about that i thought incoming presidents were expected to implement policies that reflect their own values and agenda if those value conflict with existing polices so be it thats why we have elections from the view of those of us who voted for obama having trump as our president may result in unfortunate changes but he wont be the president forever and the next theres a presidential election we will have a chance to vote somebody in who can hopefully undo the policies of president donald trump
178,i really cant see how some people complain that obamacare is not affordable it is affordable to me with the subsidies if their income is not high enough they would qualify for the same subsidies as i do if they dont qualify for subsidy then their income is high enough to pay for the coverage themselves granted its not the perfect plan only one payer would be better but its better than what we had before 2014 which was nothing 
179,if you listen to what the republicans are saying they want to undo obamas policies but have know idea what to replace them with the aca is just the shining example they want to repel right away but the repel will not take effect for a year or more until they come up with a plan medicare want to turn over to private insurance industry but have no idea what the voucher will be want to repel the clean power plan have no idea what will be save limits on carbon methane and other exhausts for the environment want to open off shore oil drilling have no new regulations in place to prevent another deep water horizon disasterbrwe as citizens of this great nation have the responsibility to protect our democracy from these attacks fight them 
180,its a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader and we intend to do itbrbrso what had your job been for the last 8 years senator mcconnell  obstruction  obstruction  obstruction  you senator are a disgrace to our government and should be ashamed of yourself  
181,if only hillary had never used a private email account and server for government business if only the democratic party had not nominated such a flawed candidate now hillary is out nobody cares which server she uses now and trump is in thank you dnc donna brazile and debbie wasserman schultz you really served your party well 
182,in peril  more like most are being reversed  which is why trump was elected
183,mitch mcconnell showed no ethics blocking the supreme court nominee he needs to resign  a disgrace
184,no time for hubris senator mcconnell  it was not hubris when you declared that your number one priority was to make president obama a one term president  
185,no mitch mcconnell is not stupid he is antiamerican in spirit  and geo washington certainly would have found him underhanded and odious im of the same mind as washington
186,once more  politics was never obamas thing  so tragic for the nation  made trump inevitable  trump got that bernie got that but hillary didnt  why obamas begging was lost on the big blue wall
187,the difference between democrats and republicansbrwhen you trip and fall a democrat will lend you a hand to get upbra republican will take your wallet and walk away
188,the headline on your front page is quite humorous republicans want to repeal health carebrbrthe most powerful and ambitious republicanled congress in 20 years plans to reserve the first 100 days for top priorities like a health care repealbrbrsorry youll have to scaremonger harder than that how about being accurate and saying that republicans want to repeal the affordable care act which has proven to be anything but affordable
189,to all of the blue collar democrats who voted for trump and the young people who didnt bother to show up for hillary you are about to get everything you deserve
190,politics was never obamas thing  so tragic for the nation  made trump inevitable  trump got that bernie got that but hillary didnt  why obamas begging was lost on the big blue wall
191,if trump and his lackey sen mitch dr just say no mcconnell try to cut medicare and va hospital care and benefits i plan to be on the front line barricades fighting them as an 83yearold disabled korean war vet i plan to contact about a dozen other vets get in our cars and close down major highways bridges tunnels etc we will spread the word on facebook and other social media to other vets and they will join us to shut this country down until some sanity is restored to this country we cannot let the inmates take over the asylum
192,swamp is as swamp doesbrbrthat is if you manage to drain it itll just fill back up sooner or later  because its a swamp
193,i think there is hope and i think it will workbrbrcongressional democrats must deal with reality and appeal to trumps extreme competitive spiritbrbrif congress with the help of mccain can block trumps plan pivot to russia instead of a huge focus on fossil fuels through exxon and rosneft a harmful and also outdated approach perhaps trump will instead switch his focus towards competing with china in a technology race with rampd and innovationbrbreven with the us pioneering in genetics china is now leading the waybrbra hrefhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20161230chinas9billionefforttobeattheusingenetictestingutmterm76b2817f3960 titlehttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20161230chinas9billionefforttobeattheusingenetictestingutmterm76b2817f3960 targetblankhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20161230chinas9billionabrbrafterall it was russias accomplishments that inspired the space race and efforts of this scale required government investment not tax cutsbrbrif trump can put his intense competitive spirit to good use through  government instead of relying on tax cuts we could go very far in some areasbrbrthis would be good for the economybrbrperhaps when he takes charge he will see a different angle to his legacy  if people point out how much better some other countries do with healthcare and rampd  he may not want to be outdone and this may save these programsbrbri suggest a huge push to point out the areas in which we lag or will soon lag without serious government investment  brbri think trump will care about the us being number 1 in these areas once he is president  brbrit is his extreme competitive nature we can appeal to and put to good use
194,how should i say this and make myself clear as a reflection in a mirror because i am terribly angry at the hypocrisy of the conservatives in this country donald j trump has set up two love affairs with two different countries and his followers follow because this is what they do both countries have rulers who are angry bossy totalitarian and one maybe behind murders of people who question him dissent one of these countries we send billions to and its boss still complains that we dont do enough amp god forbid someone criticize them bull dozing homes of people who want to just go to work sleep eat but by god russia and israel both have universal healthcare israel even calls it a human right amp indirectly we could and paying for their healthcare so its ok to love other socialist countries its just that we cant be cant be one got it what a joke
195,i hope that republicans pursue a clear principled agenda designed to benefit the many and not just the few   and i hope for a principled opposition from democratsbrbrbut i suspect that as usual the republican agenda will benefit the large corporations and the oil and gas companies at the expense of the mom and pop businesses and the vast majority of americans  and that republicans are putting  more effort in how to deceive the voters than in how to help thembrbrif the past is any guide  republicans will produce legislation to privatize medicare and social security and call it the medicare and social security rescue act  they will enact tax reform giving crumbs to the middle class and too much to the 1  and call it the income equity tax reform act  they will sanction health insurance company death panels and remove regulations on health insurance and call it the guarantied health insurance for all actbrbrcongressional republicans are an adept cynical lot who excel at serving their donors while giving crumbs to their constituentsbrbrand trump has already revealed his tiny hands in his cabinet picks  not one of them has shown any interest in resolving problems of the poor and working class  all have shown ability in selfpromotion and serving the interests of those who would turn this country back to the robber barons  brbrin 4 to 8 years voters will once again come to their senses after more catastrophes like the great recession i hope it is not too late
196,what goes around comes around  bracing for decades of obstructionism to come
197,amazing how the congress  republicans  can whip into action and work 100 days straight  without 6 week  vacations   when they want to get something done brbrfirst order of business a tax cut for the wealthy and the bill for you and ibrsecond order of business repeal of your health care insurancebrthird order of business eliminate all agencies that protect you and ibrfourth order of business head to back rooms for cuban cigars  they wont repeal that  and bourbon to congratulate themselves at being masters of the universe brbrthen back to six weeks vacations brbrthis is what you voted for people  at least a minority of you  
198,i cannot imagine senator mcconnell doing anything positive for anyone other than himself and his campaign contributors brbrhe has control now and will help bring in the conservative utopia republicans have always hoped foronly white people are included of coursebrbrpeople who helped elect trump you own the next 4 yrs
199,all i can think is show me the moneybrok mitch now that obama is gone there and  nothing left  just to be against it is time for you to show us your hand  step out on the stage and tell us what you have  for us  the people of this country that pay your salary 
200,while mr trump talks a lot about the problem he seems to have few good ideas for what to do about itbrbrlets be fairbrbrmr trump has exactly as many good ideas about how to solve this problem as he has about solving any of americas other problems
201,from my perspective here in silicon valley pain management has completely collapsed a patient at the stanford pain management clinic was recently told we dont prescribe opioids they did however offer her ketamine that horse tranquilizer nobody there wants to lose their licenses by prescribing anything like an opioid i can understand that but what about the patient in painbrbri realize that other areas of the country are awash in these drugs but the physicians and clinics here in northern california that i know of anyway are so worried about the dea that they barely give any pain medication at all at 70 years old i am currently in good health but i fear what will happen if i eventually need pain meds doctors only recommend nsaids  no matter what the side effects or the source of the pain for them opioids have ceased to exist problem solved i guess brbrtreat addicts and address addiction as a top priority but please dont deny people in real pain 
202,the most important first step political leaders can take is to approach drug abuse as a medical crisis not as a personal failing or as a matter for heavy handed legal treatmentbrthat means understanding why drug use including legally prescribed painkillers can feel enjoyable even as it is in truth destructive and what drug use does to the brain  its not about characterbrthat also means trying to reduce the destructive consequences of addiction from having antidotes readily on hand to having detox services available to utilizing clean needle exchanges as a means of reducing blood borne pathogens including hivbrunfortunately at present the attorney general wants to use the long arm of the law to pursue even statesanctioned marijuana use and the president disparagingly referred to one state as a drug infested den imagines that his fantastical border wall is the solution and used a state of the union address to call for executing drug dealers  it will take better thinkers than these to take on this crisis
203,thank you for bringing all of these details to forefront  youre right identifying these business practices and associations is more important than any of the other scandals in that it reveals the origins of the corruption of which the subsequent collusion and intimidation are symptoms
204,under contract with the democratic national committee and hillary clinton campaign peter fritsch and glenn simpson paid former british christopher steele to produce the steele dossier steele is a foreign national paying a foreign national to conduct political campaign work is a violation of the federal election campaign act  
205,if mr trump broke the law that should be the end of the story as it would be for anyone who breaks the law  that these entanglements make it difficult to do his job as president is important but not as important as the fact of law breakingbrbrtrump can not be let off the hook because of his position which perhaps he hoped would be the case as he took the job  it was so for the clinton impeachment which hinged on things much smaller than these and must be the case as criminal facts are revealed about our con man in chief
206,this reporting has not uncovered conclusive evidence that the trump organization or its principals knowingly abetted criminal activity and its not reasonable to expect the company to keep track of every condo buyer in a trumpbranded building but mr trumps company routinely teamed up with individuals whose backgrounds should have raised red flagsbrbra lots been reported about shady deals such as the florida mansion purchased by donald trump for a song  sold a few years later for 50 million profit to the russian king of fertilizer likely to hide money during a messy divorcebrbrtrump of course claimed to know nothing about the purchaserbrbrmy personal belief is when enough people say the same things about way the trump organization does businessthat it routinely turns a blind eye to the backgrounds of the people it made deals withthings have a way of being truebrbrwho knows if robert mueller is investing redline activities as defined by donald trump as part of his investigation  brbrbut given the amount of smoke constantly swirling about trumps highwire business dealings its not off base to suspect a bunch of fires
207,when the global 1 own 12 of all the wealth in the world there will be no end to corruption stories the international financial system is designed to be opaque and those with the sharpest pencils are able to game the system all these shell games are the norm as the panama papers showed and many governments profit too by attracting wealthy their shores mueller and likeminded people who believe in honesty and justice need to keep peeling the onion no matter how much their eyes sting 
208,one element that could give the prosecution  whether civil or criminal  an edge is the level of competence in the legal team trump has used over the many decades  these are extremely complicated issues and its possible that trump may have been as dismissive of his need to do business with expert legal advice as he has been regarding every other type of expert advicebrbrfor instance his attorney michael cohen attended law school at western michigan university cooley law school  according to wikipedia in 2017 the school was one of ten american law schools found to be out of compliance with the american bar associations requirement that schools only admit students who appear capable of earning a jd degree and passing the bar examination  the school was recently ranked the worst law school in the country by above the lawbrbrstormy daniels lawyer michael avenatti stated that the nda cohen drafted was so incompetent had someone in his firm put it together they would have been firedbrbrthe situations discussed in this article have become public knowledge  what we dont know  and cant know until theyre at issue in court  is how skillful their paperwork and legal documentation is  trumps entire empire could be a house of cards thats managed to remain standing on mere bluster and intimidation
209,if youve ever wondered why trump often seems to behave with all the tact and diplomacy of a mob boss well it may be because so many of his business partners are involved with organized crime in their respective countries 
210,americans need to be sure that major foreign policy decisions are made in the national interest  not because of foreign ties forged by the presidents business ventures that sentence bears repeatingbrbramericans also need assurance that the president isnt subject to extortion for fear of having shady dealings revealed by questionable business associates or by foreign powers taking advantage of such dirty deals do we have any reason to suspect this might be the case how about the statements about a flood of russian investment money allegedly said by don jr or the refusal of president trump to release his tax returns or his refusal to properly divest himself from his businesses upon taking office or his claims during the campaign of having no russian investments while such a deal was in the works as he spokebrbri see plenty of reason to worry and so should president trump
211,thank you for this very clear outline of the potential that our president has a history of shady business deals one has to wonder how someone with so many bankruptcies to his name could emerge financially intact its also easy to imagine that a business organization with a horrible track record of dealing with partners would be able to stay in business only by partnering with groups that need to launder money one way or anotherbrbri was struck by the earlier stories of trump stiffing small contractors especially in atlantic city as well as the trump university debacle why that information didnt ring alarm bells among the electorate is something that continues to confound me one can only hope that these more international dealings will get more of the negative attention that trump so richly deserves
212,i remember soon after the death of yeltzin when it had become clear that the russian hope for a quantum leap into a truly democratic state had waned thinking that russia and the world would not be spared the slow road russians would need to pass through the various stages through which we passed to get here  perhaps if they were lucky having the historical examples those stages might be compressed but they would need to be passed through the first that primarily features capitalistic oligarchy still very much holds russians in its graspbrbrone emblem of that phase is great wealth accumulated by few not by inventing something that revolutionizes the world and creates greater general prosperity but through financial manipulation theft and control of assets unknown billions have been looted  perhaps trillions  and squirreled away in geneva in london in new york and in many other places money in those quantities would fund corruption globally and perhaps not even knowingly on the part of the counterparties although most surely just turned away their eyesbrbrthe authors obviously desirous of crippling donald trump by whatever means available actually are hopeful that what turns up in cohens legal records and in trumps business records document transactions that can be used to pillory him  perhaps even destroy him i certainly wouldnt be surprised if he undertook transactions to acquire funding for his projects from unsavory russians
213,per the fecbrbrdespite the general prohibition on foreign national contributions and donations foreign nationals may lawfully engage in political activity that is not connected with any election to political office at the federal state or local levels the commission has issued advisory opinions that help to define the parameters of that activitybrbrunder the rules as i understand them foreign nationals simply cant work on elections themselves brbrfactfinding seems to be far enough from that but im not a lawyer so perhaps a lawyer could clarify
214,if such transactions are documented well see what slime will stick to trump however what the authors miss or see and discard as unimportant so long as they get trump is what this will do to us beyond trump such discoveries eventually could implicate hundreds or thousands of others in america and globally for practices in obtaining funding that just about everyone who needs funding in such quantities employs  sometimes when you need to borrow billions you cant afford to think that they might come from an investor who stole russian petroleum assets and is politically aligned with vladimir putinbrbrand beyond that this intensifying process of demonization of anyone political who opposes you will not be ignored by the kochs and others expect soon to see every democrat who shows statewide and national political potential investigated similarly and every secret they have made public  not to keep politicians honest because theyre all as naturally convenient in their ethical views as anyone else but to destroy them utterly for political reasons to date for instance and to our knowledge no detailed comprehensive forensic analysis has been done on the financial machinations of the clinton foundation wait for it following that money should be interestingbrbrwere heading for a polarized allout war where the weapons used by both sides are excrement why would highly competent people think of seeking to serve in elective or appointed roles only to face that
215,unknown billions have been looted  perhaps trillions  and squirreled away in geneva in london in new york and in many other places money in those quantities would fund corruption globally and perhaps not even knowingly on the part of the counterparties although most surely just turned away their eyes
216,there is a certain complacency borne of being the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth  one forgets that fortune is fleeting  empires have crumbled  fearsome militaries have been defeated  economies have collapsed  competitors have overtaken financial powerhousesbrbut what the united states until now had in our favor was moral strength  yes slavery was an indefensible part of our history but we have endeavored and still do to break free of its terrible legacy  no we cant remake every government into a democratic mold but we had standards for ourselvesbrunder trump that forwardlooking leadership is lost  the man in our highest office appeals to peoples lowest impulses on race women immigrants religious minorities anyone who doesnt look like him  he embraces makes excuses for and emulates ruthless dictators  trump trashes pillars of our countrys foundations  a free press independent judiciary autonomous legislative powers separation and church and state intelligence agents operating free from political considerationsbrto truly make america great again we need a president who respects just what made america great all along
217,i think the idea that america must be at the very top of the international and militarial order through its might and sheer force is absolutely out of touch with the international reality that we ourselves have created our goals during the cold war were to empower as many nations as possible to join our side and to choose democracy and capitalism now that they have they have become stronger and more effective nations who have a voice on the international stage and wish to keep said voice this is the world that we have created but now we have leaders who seemingly want to return to a type of cold war posture in which america calls all the shots with total disregard for the allies who we have purposely strengthened for the new world the 1950s and 60s are gone and they are never coming back again we cant expect to nor should we want to revive the geopolitics of the cold war just as we must adapt to the economy of the future so should we adapt to the broader geopolitics of that future
218,mr prebles analysis offers useful advice on how the us can adapt to a rapidly changing international environment  he doesnt seem to appreciate however the artificial nature of american economic and military dominance in the postwwii erabrbrpreble notes that after the war the us  accounted for about half of total world output  even before the war we had the worlds largest economy but the extraordinary level of our dominance after 1945 stemmed directly from the conflicts impact  most of our rivals whether allies or enemies suffered devastating  destruction of both human and physical capital while the war stimulated a huge investment in our own resources  the huge differential between our output and that of the rest of the world reflected not the inherent superiority of the american economy but the dislocations created by warbrbrthe wisdom of american policy after the war lay in the recognition that we could not remain prosperous in an impoverished world  once our aid had helped other countries to recover of course our artificial dominance inevitably diminished despite the continued growth of our gdpbrbrthis healthy trend also altered the military balance of power  in this case however americans have resisted their loss of preeminence by spending more than we can afford on weapons  by skimping on investment in our own economy and people we risk the future wellbeing of our country  we can no longer afford to spend billions on a single aircraft carrier
219,we have a president who ran on the motto of make america great again  we have a gop run congress that is not willing to look at better ways to spend money  they overhauled our taxes in ways that are guaranteed to hurt the very americans they claim to care about  more than a few in congress have no understanding of how science works care nothing for spending money on diplomacy and see using our military as the best way to enforce our supremacy  oddly enough wed do better if we didnt spend so much on the military and put more of our tax dollars towards our infrastructure improving our social safety net upgrading our educational systems and paying more attention to 99 of our citizens rather than the richestbrbrour decline is coming about because of our own blindness in who we elect to serve and in how we see the world  we are not a well traveled nation  we do not have to speak several languages to get along in our country or in our hemisphere  we take the view that whats good for america is good for the world  that shortsightedness has hurt us in the past and if its not changed will hurt us even more in the immediate future  brbramerica needs a marshall plan similar to what it did for europe  if we want to be at least the equal of western europe and retain our importance we need to start by helping our own and learning from other nations  we are not the only nation or the one that is most advanced any longer  we have competitors
220,republicans know how to minimize their losses thats what they did in 2006brbrin 2006 democrats regained control of congress however exit poll data shows that there was gross vote count manipulation and it had a great impact on the results of e2006 significantly decreasing the magnitude of what would have been accurately tabulated a landslide of epic proportions the same may happen in 2018 if our votes continue to be counted in secretbrbrjonathan simon and bruce odell landslide denied exit polls vs vote countbra hrefhttpstinyurlcomy5fk4r titlehttpstinyurlcomy5fk4r targetblankhttpstinyurlcomy5fk4rabrthe election defense alliance website is downbrbrin the next two midterm elections republicans beat the odds theyre just super luckybrbrin 2010 with 300 safe house seats republicans won an unprecedented 128 of the remaining 135 seats with a small national vote share even though close races should break about evenbrbrin 2014 the republican congress approval rating was in the single digits the gop wrecking crew swept up more seats despite the fact that progressive ballot measures passed by wide margins even in nonblue statesbrbrour ballots the memory cards and source code have been deemed corporate property the system has been set up for concealment we dont conduct banking without a transparent and verifiable process why are we putting blind faith in secret vote countsbrbrgermany ireland the netherlands and norway went back to counting ballots by hand after realizing the vulnerabilities with computerized voting

227,is it any wonder that much of the world is either laughing at the united states or in the case of our allies deeply concerned about the rapid loss of leadership by the president and the political party he now controlsbrbrthe senate debacle in west virginia and spreading across our country is symptomatic of trumpism an ideology of the far right with roots in the tea party and the extreme right they found a voice in trump and now we have an anything goes mentality when putting up candidates on the gop sidebrbrour only way out of this mess is to vote vote vote in november joe manchin isnt ideologically pure enough forget about it the character of this coal magnate in prison can win on trumps coattails unless americans exercise their right to vote
228,one could argue that without a 60 vote margin the senate is the most ineffective wing of our present governmental triad the abuse of the filibuster has made all but wholly agreed upon legislation impassable ive heard the usual false equivalencies about who is to blame for this speed  bump turning into a solid wall but really has anyone ever heard of anything remotely more seditious than the republicans plotting to give obama no legislative victories before he was sworn in or before any legislation was proposed even if it was their own idea initially see obamacare we all know and can feel what the future holds marijuana legalization universal healthcare stricter gun laws equal pay for women equal treatment for blacks more diversity in hiring and less religious oppression because these ideas make sense in a pluralistic society however i feel i will pass away before i see any of these changes because the right refuses to let progress proceed unless it benefits them politically and their donors financially we the people are the last thing on their list    
229,democrats can make considerable gains even a majority in congress this year if we put aside ideology and let candidates speak to the issues their immediate constituents care most about and in a representative mannerbrin recent months we saw doug jones and conor lamb win upset victories for a senate and house seat respectively although neither is a prototype democrat  they both are hardly tools of trump and the far right gop agenda so their victories are well worth itbrrepublicans set up a trap of conforming to an inflexible platform notably jeff flake and bob corker who have resisted that pressure are also out of the running  democrats can be broaderminded than their counterparts and in so doing win congress
230,it is staggering how bereft of morals todays republican luminaries are people who are responsible for mining disasters revenge porn completely inappropriate relationships with teenage girls should not be making decisions for the rest of usbrbrwhich is why mcconnells laserlike focus on winning at all costs is so suspect his goal of lining up a cast of characters hellbent on destroying the government the environment health care education land conservation and womens lives makes him as unhinged as trump maybe more so because he does it so quietly brbrits a shame that senators like corker and flake who have stepped back from the insanity will be overlooked will be tarred as bipartisan todays republicans have no right to the claim of gop theyre tea party extremists and should be labeled as such 
231,are there any republicans who arent loathsome selfserving or psychologically defective people  the fact that the president is the head of their party doesnt say much for those who want to enable and apologize for himbrbrit makes you wonder if the republican politicians who are eager to serve under this human outhouse fire have our best interests at heart or if theyre simply reveling in the chaos he creates  whos watching the store while the boss has us transfixed with his legendary stupid antics  what minor crimes go unnoticed while the mobbossinchief is distracting us with inane tweets unbefitting a slow schoolchildbrbrmany of these candidates are famous for their bizarre and disgusting behavior whether its sexual criminal or just abusive  and yet there are droves of voters who rally behind them because they think these hypocritical creeps are looking out for the little guy  they should know that they eat little guys for lunch and then stick them with the billbrbrwhen such a large part of the population of a country is no longer able tell that theyre embarrassing us as a nation while voting against their own interests maybe america is done  the heartland has spoken and the brainland is on the ropesbrbrthis isnt about electing politicians  its about determining the future of our countryand if we even have one

235,whatever your politics it is easy to recognize that barbara bush was a class act and she and her husband great patriots and loving parents had a wonderful marriage  may she forever rest in peace and may president bush find peace and tranquility in the warm comfort of his family
236,exquisite maureen dowd your paean to first lady barbara bush  wife of president ghw bush and mother of president gwbush  truly a woman of valor  most admirable and lovely among women  in our american history  she spoke from her heart her entire long life attending her obsequies on tv in texas today all americans who cared and still care for her were deeply moved thank you  she will live vibrant and strong in our national memory and hearts

238,barbara bushs caustic wit had a very dark callous and insensitive side as when she said about katirna victims temporarily housed in the houston astrodome  that they were underprivileged anyway so this is working very well for them  and then when she heard that many wanted to relocate to houston she found it scary  i wish she had had the class to take those remarks back theyre much more than just shade until now theyve stuck in my mind as a lasting impression of her and left me with the feeling that like her disturbed mother she had a very mean perhaps racist side that may have been one reason the reagans wanted to keep her at arms length  and having cleared my conscience i also offer her my forgiveness and will try to replace all those memories with all the good deeds that she did like promoting childhood literacy
239,i generally respect people who speak their minds and arent always politically correct and i know that being the wife and mother of presidents requires someone with a certain strength of will and grit that ill never havebrbrbut id just as soon leave these folks alone  they work in ways and do things that would probably make us cringe  anyone who could think w was a good idea or that jeb was what this country needed would have to be their mother  i had no such appreciation for their talentsbrbrmrs bush lost me when my city was nearly destroyed and she made snide comments about the poor new orleans evacuees who were struggling to survive in the houston astrodomebrbrim sure she did some nice and compassionate things along the way  she certainly lived a long and colorful life but the evacuee quip and her famous remark about not wasting her beautiful mind on body bags returning from iraq did it for me
240,it is customary to laud the deceased decent people get it and to blame president george w bush on mrs barbara bush is quite unfair why one shouldnt blame president hw bush on her either to borrow from the senior bush they are their own manbrbrthat said perhaps she should have stuck to her original when she said there are enough bushes at the white house gov jeb bush might have a better brain of the family his florida track records and his charisma or lack thereof have foretold a waste of campaign dollarsbrbrotherwise she could have been a great person so happened to be married to a republican party family being prochoice though she would have been shunned these days
241,ive had the strangest reaction to mrs bushs passing  i never paid much attention to her and thought when i did think about her that she seemed callous to katrina victims at the houston astrodome and that somehow she raised a son to become a torturerinchief  until she died i didnt know about her literacy cause she said what could be better than holding a child in your arms and reading and i agree  i didnt know about her hugging babies with aids to lessen our fears  i didnt know about the 27 moves in 73 years of marriage  i did know about the death of robin but didnt know her hair turned white practically overnight  i laughed out loud at the story of telling the doctor that w turned out the way he did because she drank and smoked during her pregnancy with him  and so many other things ive learned  maybe im still grieving for my mother who also died at 92  i dont know  but i have cried real tears for bar bush and i hope she is with her daughter now leaving a large loving family behind in the material worldbrbrher pearls may have been fake  but she was the real deal  
242,thanks for sharing your memories mo and the further elucidation of class grit and common sense of mrs bush  flecked with the foibles we all have of being only humanbrbrshe reminds us all that our works live on after us through those that we inspire support encourage and perhaps teach  simply nurturebrbramericans should all nurture more as neighbors and a society as a whole calling out and rejecting those who only want to cannibalize what has been built up through past nurturingbrbrit is our duty

246,no good deed goes unpunished it seems of course the problem is deeply rooted and deeply entrenched but starbucks is at least doing something credit where credit is due
247,training versus education when i read a problem starbucks cant train away i wrongly presumed the opinion piece was about the dynamics of changing human behavior i was wrong nothing could have been further from the truth my perception of this opinion piece is it highlights the continuing challenge the many people face regarding unconditional acceptance in the 21st century mr thrasher would have been correct had he pursued the theme starbucks cant train away the treatment two visitors to their store received we can train employees to follow policies and procedures or face the consequences changing how we interact with each other is in very large part about education and followed consequences somewhere many years ago i read or heard the following we train animals and we educate people employees memo to starbucks ensure whatever adult learning model you use please education first train model the appropriate behaviors you require of employees and then reinforce with audits and if necessary consequences ill take a dark roast venti 
248,somehow ignored in all of this is something called trespassing  this is a law enforced by police as it was at starbucks when a business wants a person off their property  and usually when they refuse to leave  reports differ on whether starbucks asked the gentleman to leave but clearly the police were asked to have these customers vacate the store and they refused multiple time  hence they were arrestedbrbrthe fact that starbucks later realized they had a pr fiasco saw there might not have been a good justification for having them removed and then told police to drop the charges does not negate the original situation it does not mean the cops made a wrong decision  somehow this is being ignored and wrapped in the flag of identity politics  brbrive been on the end of a unfair arrest after being stopped for speeding and taken to jail because a court clerk did not update my case file correctly making it appear as though i had an outstanding warrant  did i like it no of course not  but the quickest way to fix it was to cooperate
249,yes yes yes all true mr thrasher there is a deep cultural and societal racism against people of color especially africaamericans i would also add some neurobiological research that shows that all of us are biased against the other the stranger we have a strong positive bias towards our kin what is familiar to us research shows that we have a stronger fear response towards the unfamiliar when signals come in through the thalamus and normally would be distributed to the appropriate processing centers like the visual cortex but their is heightened stress there is direct shortcut to the amygdala and the signal is processed according to our biases it is true for all races to portray that only a certain race is capable of racism is a misconstruction that science does not support
250,to caitlinbrbron further examination is it possible that there is an error in the clue list on the sitebrthe given clue is dine twice but in your piece you seem to be saying that the clue wasbrbbrubrrbrg
251,maybe the clues gave too much away but this was relatively easy
252,six packs was something new and differentbrbrspoiler alertbrbri first incorrectly assumed that the cardiological answer would not be from artery because that would be too fitting and therefore probably wrongbrbrthe hardest answer for me was the one about piano or accordion i searched in vain but then suddenly realized that it was keyboard instrument from ardent

255,cant see it without a subscription  but the print version in the magazine does not reflect what you saw
256,yes this is strangebrabout a halfhour ago i entered a comment about it that i addressed to caitlinbrit wound up on the top of this column
257,this man is an outrage as a public servant he must be dropped from the epa and then charged with the millions of dollars of public money he has squandered
258,what were those famous words outta the donalds mouth br     drain the swamp  br      we all knew those were empty words butbr   this guys a whole nother swamp unto himselfbr      needs a name like the great dismal
259,in pruitt we see a man who was shamelessly ambitious and would stop at nothing to get ahead who obscured any lines between his personal business and public policy who enriched himself at the expense of the common people but kept them at arms length and for whom the environment is a small price to pay for having more green coming to himbrits hard to imagine trump finding anyone more emblematic of the swamp than pruitt
260,the apparent corruption cronyism and self dealing are breathtaking in scope the silence from the republican side of congress is appalling but sadly not surprising
261,pruitt is trumps minime no wonder he wont toss him to the side of the road like he has many of initial appointee
262,pruitts conceitedness radiates from his face these revelations shame congressional members who approved his nomination from pruitt to trump to devos why are antiregulation socalled conservatives also thoroughly corrupt theyve soiled their offices 
263,having scott pruit in charge of the epa is like having dracula in charge of the blood bank
264,what a pathetic sad little man  put him in his phone booth and throw away the key
265,to my mind this is the biggest threat posed by facebook the viral spread of unchecked information connected to real people in areas of extreme conflict its like the rawandan radio station urging listeners to genocide on crack facebook must have editorial boards and stations on the ground staffed with trained journalists fluent in the local language and culture just like a newspaper or media company too burdensome and expensive then shut down operations in that region simple its time for facebook to open its eyes to the horrible human tendencies it is dousing with kerosene and for governments and users to hold it responsible 
266,two suggestionsbrbr1 join airbnb so you can monitor your neighbors ad if problems arise suggest to your neighbor different ad language eg quiet street very residential youll also be able to check future availability which for an otherwise vacant townhouse suggests when to expect rentersbrbr2 get an inexpensive security cam to monitor the number of guests which may be useful for complaints to the city or for legal action while this can raise some legal privacy issues youd have ample legal counterarguments
267,i am a residential landlord with a few multifamily houses in a city i cannot imagine renting out an air bampb in a house i was not living in and even then its immoral to burden the neighbors with random strangers coming in and outbrbrlandlords that are not complete idiots most are dumber than dirt know that keeping the neighbors happy is important any neighbor that complains to me i thank because 1 they are telling me something i may not know 2 if they are complaining to me they probably havent called the city yet i try to keep it that way
268,at minimum get your neighbors contact information  if i were trying to manage a property i owned from afar or even from down the block id want the neighbors to be able to contact me or my management company  this is a requirement in the small beach town where my family has a vacation home brbrproperty owners must get permitstheres a waiting listto use their property as a shortterm rental and must give contact info to the neighbors  this is usually to the management company overseeing the rental but it is sometimes to the homeowners trying to save a few dollars by managing the property themselves  three complaints to the city and the homeowner loses the rental permit  absentee homeowners trying to work without management companies receive the most official complaints in town because there is usually no one on hand to control the renters  too bad airbnb cant do this  brbrmy    
269,nobody wants to live next to an airbnb and these properties disrupt residential neighborhoods in the worst way possible reduce the number of residential properties available for sale and for longterm rentals to actual city residents and create safety and security problems how can you know your neighbors and watch out for them if the property next door hosts a revolving door of tourists the fact is airbnbs are unsupervised hotels operating in residential neighborhoods and security for them is effectively outsourced to neighbors who will be the first response to any problems in areas where operating airbnbs is illegal the platform supports people who do it anyway thus enabling tax cheats and scofflaws im disappointed that ms kaysen didnt point out the obvious having an airbnb next door reduces your property value safety and security and quality of life brbrcontact your local codes department and find out if this use is legal if it isnt support action to shut the airbnb down if it is work with your local government to change the law to protect actual residents property values rather than the rights of investors who want to make a fast buck at neighbors expense
270,unfortunately if you read the article it sounds like what this persons neighbor is doing is perfectly legal under nyc code as long as she isnt using any rooms as bedrooms that do not qualify as bedrooms brbrthere are many air bampbs in nyc that would not be legal such as apartments in multiple dwelling structures but this one sounds legal 
271,its rare that i can make it through a saturday with no lookups but i was able to on this one with a lot of effort gaymarriage and eroticnovel both gave me helpful footholds brbrim so glad to see across the great divide posted i love the band so much and i am grateful i got to see levon helm perform at one of his midnight rambles shortly before he passed my husband and i watch the last waltz and festival express over and over  highly recommended films

273,isnt isaiah misspelled in the puzzle
274,this puzzle looked pretty hopeless to me at first managed to get a dozen or so answers before life took over the next few hours were so busy i gave absolutely no thought to the puzzle upon my return things didnt look much better but then i got one word then another  until only two words were incomplete over to caitlin then which gave me ferrell and then came the music
275,for the first time my progress echoed very closely that of the author of the article not of the puzzle im pretty sure that has no significance but it comforts me anyway ive been doing this for about fifty or sixty years 
276,i keep seeing comments about people using computers or friends or whomever i always thought the challenge to crosswords especially the times was to do it singlehandedly no references aids or friends not much of a challenge to me can someone clue me in on the rules if any is it anything goes
277,che is a slang term used for someone from argentina which is how ernesto guevara got his nickname  it comes from an interjection used along the rio de la plata that i always thought was related to italian ce since there are so many argentinians of italian origin though this wikipedia article says otherwisebra hrefhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicheinterjection titlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikicheinterjection targetblankhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicheinterjectiona

283,about the kilt clue i blame autocorrect it undoubtedly it was meant to read attire thats often checked and then we could all laugh and tell stories about whats worn under it and ponder a connection to 1a and 42d
284,in this puzzle ineedhelp is standing over a ledge 
285,my favorite puzzle in the last two weeks please return soon i love the slightly twisted clues that could go two directions had goal posts instead of helipads for a very long time made the sw quite a challenge

287,wow i went down the rabbit hole on tartan and plaid after i solved the puzzle i spent half an hour at least surfing fabric pages scots pages etc and finally realized there is one set of terms for classic tartans plaids etc and then theres what everybody else meansbrbrmy main stumbling block i eventually saw had been my unexamined connection between checkered and checkerboard an item which is of course made up of squares all the same size hmm come to think of it i will now have to go find out which came first the check or the  cannot think of a good pun on chicken or the egg entries welcomebrbrbtw for me this was a hard but fair puzzle fair as usual meaning i managed to finish it with no lookups     brbrkovik next to isiah was the cliffhanger didnt know either but in the end couldnt remember seeing that many checkered belts and the penny dropped whew brbrcongrats daniel nierberg and do come back soon

289,i agree with others consternation over the cluing for kilt  while you do find the occasional kilt that is made from tweed a fabric that is in fact checkered most are made from tartan which is most certainly not checkered be that as it may this was a fun puzzle
290,hoo boy  i resisted as long as possible in re attire thats often checkered but in the end kilt as in that nearly kilt me was in the grid  every one of my dna strands 71 suffered  i invite you to view the waddell tartan and show me any checks on it  argh argh argh  brbrthis was really a tough puzzle with several sports figures some old film characters and actors and corporations cars computer stuff and a case from scotusbrstill puzzling over the gynecologist dr t and bubble tea  who bothers with the term coed nowadays  and dont chefs deal in quantities greater than tspsbrfinally a pretty specific term at 8dwhich i knew because im an old special ed teacherbut which i am betting few people had off the batbrbrcan someone tell stan newman that the link to print a pdf of the saturday stumper is not working  blank page  and his contact form will not accept the test wordsi typed in 6 of them all correctly and they were all rejected  sheesh  or should i say yeesh

297,very nice debut with some lively entries and clever clues not a complete success for me of course but i think i might have learned something today brbri almost always end up doing themeless puzzles or any tough puzzle the same way ill start up top get stuck or just not have some things dawn on me right away and move on until i get to the bottom then ill take a deep breath and try a little harder and be more patient and end up working the puzzle from the bottom up today i got a bit more than halfway up and got stuck again and resorted to a couple of failed checks and finally looking up ferrellbrbras i look at this one if id just gone back to the north both nw and ne and tried a little harder i think i could have worked my way back down from there i see where i hesitated to put in my best guess on several answers on my first pass but filled them in immediately when i got back up there maybe ill learn

303,had to do a little research to get some of these but erotic novel was my first entry which started the nw corner off fairly well started with helipad saw it was too short and went for heliport then shadowbox orca was a gimme and then the downs helped a lot in the se in the ne i was thinking more of classrooms and tried i need to go before i need help but bubble tea filled in as soon as i had bic uno and bee overall i did it in half my sat averagebrbrinteresting note some orcas have learned how to kill great white sharks as well as penguins they ram the shark which stuns it then hold it inverted which makes the shark go into a kind of trance and hold it that way until it dies
304,of course obergefell didnt concern gay marriage it concerned the rights of gay people to just plain marriage
305, im not an expert on kilts but im pretty sure they are usually plaid not checkered 
306,a little slower than average for me had a lot of empty space in the e and se for a long while i knew obergefell was a recent case and thought maybe abortion or birth control but couldnt get either to work tried i need to go for 13d so that didnt help  after i had many letters i thought maybe carrell for 37a brbrcant say i really get themed for topical i think of topical as related to current events hmm i guess topical as in on some topic so i guess that worksbrbrgreat divide is a new one on me bubble tea seemed vaguely familiar though i had no idea what it wasbrbrbee orb ncis che epee itsy lysis nonart cris orca shadow box isiah brae drt were entrees for me

312,thats how mr thomas spells it
313,its an honor system you make your own rules i also note theres not a lot of boasting here theres not much use in comparing streaks or completion times since one person may have used google and the other did not here are my personal rules no lookups at all sunday thru thursday help with proper names on friday and saturday if im down to no more than one blank crossing letter this usually happens when two proper nouns cross i never look at full answer keys i also look up less and less each week because now i know how to spell esai morales todays isiah thomas is a good example i had all 5 letters and it still looked wrong so i bingd for the spelling
314,in a crossword puzzle tournament there are rulesbrfor amusement only do whatever you likebrbrit is polite but not required to note here how you solve not just that you have solved and most commenters do just that  brbrsolo no references
315,okay i get it thanks it is not too much fun for me to look up answers so i never got that esaimorales i dont even know who she or he is but i figured it had to be right sometimes i just leave a puzzle i cant solve now to be really honest i am at the age where i forget things and the crossword is kind of my reference point if i can still solve it no dementia no alzheimers  in a way i owe will  what i would be spending on whatever specialty would reach the same conclusion  now that would be a good theme wouldnt it dementia

322,i would have expected bubble tea to show up first in a clue  since tapioca has so many useful letters and i also was led astray by the word fruity
323,no milk necessary for bubble tea on the other hand re other comments i dont think it is ever carbonated
324,mickey strictly speaking no bubble tea doesnt require milk however simply tea sweetened or otherwise wouldnt be nearly as good in a bubble tea  milk adds the creaminess sugar the sweetness which complements the astringent tea and the boba goes better with the sweet creaminess than with just the teabrbrbut im no connoisseur of bubble tea my family likes them and get them from time to time id have a sip or two but prefer plain oolong tea unsweetened unmilked unbobaed
325,the shah is to blame chess as we have it comes from shah mat  check mate  the shah is in deadly peril  and the word descended from that in most european languages has a hard sound at the corners  checks the board gets repurposed for a game that is only known as checkers in the angloamerican world  its dames or variants otherwise
326,dr t came out at a time when i was buying lots of dvds so i happen to have a copy my recollection is that its not very good his stepbrother mr t is much better known

339,i had a different expectation conart since some claim the whole movement was a sham to create objects rich people could buy cheaply then donate to museums with a huge tax advantage
340,would you happen to have a citation for that claim by some rmp  aside from running counter to anything ive ever read or heard about dada it seems too contemporary a dodge to ascribe to a movement that started during world war i
341,agreed a kilt pattern is plaid not checkers two completely different things
342,i was curious about this too so looked up checkered one definition is just having a pattern of squares  and most kilts do fit this technically  by contrast tartan is defined as a pattern of straight lines of different colors and widths crossing at right angles definitions are from websters new world college dictionary

356,when you have a congress who is made up of predominantly middleaged white men the expectations of them being in touch with the everyday lives of most americans seems tenuous at best  everyday we see reminders about how nonprogressive our country has become full of outmoded ideas the highly suspicious and conspiracy theorists science deniers and true believers in fabricated journalism outoftouch outofstep we  also remain stuck in preconceived notions of gender roles is it any wonder then of the shocked reaction to discovering that the ace southwest airlines pilot who brought flight 1380 to a safe landing was a former navy pilot and a woman now a senator and war hero to boot is bringing an infant into the senate floorwonders never cease small steps will not a nation make but it sure does help
357,im sorry but the decision to have a child is a choice and with that choice there comes consequences the support and nurture of that child the workplace of which the senate floor could be loosely called is not a place to bring a child in particular a newborn  so are we going to extend the same courtesy to a young mother of two holding down two jobs to make ends meet can she bring her newborns to lie in cribs on the factory floor or better yet behind the counter at burger king i can guarantee they would walk her out the door  even in manhattan whiteshoe law firms a female partner would meet extreme resistance to having her child in the office  i strongly suspect that ms duckworth can afford daycare and should be able to make arrangements to have her child cared for while she is at work  this is vapid spectacle at best and will have absolutely no impact on those women who truly need assistance to care for their children while they toil to earn a living wage  leave your child at home tammy and do the work that our tax dollars are overpaying you for
358,we should show a bit of sympathy for senator mcconnells posttraumatic stress disorder from having to acknowledge a natural human condition

361,duckworth for president either one 
362,the sound of a crying baby sure beats the sound of stridently whining adults
363,just wait until she or someone else tries to breastfeed in the senate chambers 
364,tammy duckworth for president
365,still klobuchar said there were reservations some of their colleagues muttered that if you gave new mothers an inch the next thing you knew theyd be nursing on the senate floorbrbryeah sobrbrit once being okay for senators to go all buffo in the senate swimming pool i cant see what the kerfuffle is herebrbroh now i get it  one involves men and the other involves women thats whybrbri just cant wait until we show this stupid old white mens club the door
366,i briefly met sen duckworth back when she worked for the va and came to visit a program in la for combat veterans where i was working before she arrived there were a few mild jokes about the lady chopper pilot after she left there was kind of an awed silence for a little while everybody who lived at our program was working on their own stuff getting better at their own pace but after they saw and heard her speak it was a lot to think aboutbrlooks like she is still having that effect on people
367,my only objection to senator duckworth taking maile to the senate floor is the dangers inherent in exposing her to the toxic atmosphere maybe she needs to have an infant hazmat suit before being exposed to republican senators
368,i love it a majority group of mostly old mostly white mostly alpha men many of whom seem most comfortable yelling at kids to get off their lawn are suddenly faced with the unsettling prospect of infants inside their private clubhouse no doubt vapours ensued
369,i wonder whether the junior senator from texas privately threatened to filibuster this change in the chambers rules after all he most likely wants to maintain his celebrated status as the chief senate whiner
370,it certainly is understandable why gop senators would not want babies on the senate floor  brbrthese antediluvian republican politiciansfalsely advertising themselves as the family values party know they couldnt take the stares of innocent babies looking up at them in wonder and puzzlement as they pass yet another draconian budget cut and slash government programs that benefit children mothers and born babies  republicans only like fetuses and they certainly dont like other peoples childrenbrbrout of sight out of mindand these days republican politicians are outa sight with their stupidity and cruelty and outa their bloody mindsbrbrdont vote for these republican politicians until they come to their senses  could be a long wait unless we get rid of citizens united stop special interests and big donors from buying their politicians and move to the public financing of electionsbrbrwhile we are at it lets get rid of the electoral college and institute fair federal procedures for determining voting districts across this countryamongst other things  the babies would like this i think
371,thank you ms collins for highlighting all the ways tammy duckworth is an exceptional hero  the contrast between her record and that of trumps nominee to be head of nasa reminds us the senates role in advise and consent is to be more than a rubber stamp for the current president especially one like trump with a history of poorly vetting nomineesbrall us voters should be proud there are people like senduckworth willing to sacrifice and serve their country unlike the many currently in power serving only themselves and their republican party
372,the greatest news is that senator ducworth by bringing her baby in the senate elevated the intellectual calibre of the senate by 1000 in her first day in the senate baby ducworth told no lies told no stupidities did not vote for a new unqualified director of nasa in other words the presence of baby ducworth was a big win win not only for women but also for the american people
373,gail theres already a lot of teething toddlers on the floor of the senate and many have needed a diaper change for a long long time brbrwhile i welcome sen duckworth and her offspring and feel they should be welcomed everywhere including during feeding times but id like more adults in govt too we need to take away their candy change our campaign laws and make them go back to school to learn civics before allowing them to legislate anythingbrbrbut that brat in the white house needs a time out a very long time out 
374,i love gail and agree with everything she writes  i do wish she wouldnt use the trendy semiliterate expression woke though  its somewhat jarring but not very  effective  awake means the same thing and is better english
375,typically the only time members of congress remember children exist is when they suddenly announce they are quitting to spend more time with them 
376,that there was any contention at all involved with this decision illustrates just how archaic and dysfunctional the senate has become 
377,earlier this week i watched a reporter ripping on a male senator about it taking until 2018 for female senators to be allowed to bring their babies into the senate  he was apologetic but was never allowed to get a word in edgewise  finally she fired the last insult at him and cut off the feed  had i been him i would have asked what is the percentage of pay a woman receives in america vs that of a man for the same work  her answer would have been in the 70 range  then i would have said  what do you think the percentage of pay a female senator receives in america is vs that of a male senator  then i would have cut off the feedbrbrregarding bringing kids into our congress i think it is an extreme form of child abuse to expose them to the high level of incompetence there  furthermore i was amazed they were actually able to pass a rule to let senator duckworth bring her newborn into the senate
378,it amazing that the gop the party of christian family values would be against this but then i remembered that for the evangelicals in the gop christianity is only about judging others not showing any compassion
379,this column puts me in mind of michelle goldbergs column about hillary clintons complaint that they wouldnt let her win the election no she didnt allow hillary to win her own election brbrto me tammy duckworth is the antihillary bright plain spoken generous and downtoearth ms duckworth might be a powerful votegetter in a presidential race brbri doubt however that the monarchical democratic party of geriatric entitlement would ever allow such a middleaged upstart to gain a foothold in its senior leadership all seats there are reserved for the over70 crowd i hope i am wrong about thisbrbrfailing to do so pretty much assures that the party will continue to lose the younger demographic while failing to win the older we are in the midst of living with the consequences of such political mismanagement
380,absolute proof that the best multitasker is a mom  the best trailblazer is a mom  the best president will be  a mombr  any questions 
381,what we the people need now is a vote to get the dinosaurs out of the senate i mean the old men like mcconnell and grassly and another 45 or so republicans who are keeping the nation in the stone agebrcongrats to senator duckworth  i know its none of my business but having a baby at 50brblessings and love
382,why is a 50 yearold woman with the demanding job of us senator having a baby in the first place  if i was one of her constituents i wouldnt be thrilled 
383,given their opposition to abortion you would think that republicans would be falling over themselves to have a baby visit the senate  but it seems babies are not human beings who even deserve the right to be heard
384,only one way to get what youre asking for gale  everyone needs to go out and vote  of course you better hope that its the 55 of us who want these progressive things that do the voting and its not the 30 who wish it was still 1856
385,the decrepit old men objecting to mothers bringing their children onto the floor of the senate should read the handwriting on the walls and retire from the senate before their constituents wisely force them into retirement
386,i suppose its too much to hope for that the presence of a baby on the senate floor might actually move some members to consider a little more carefully how the actions theyre taking will affect all the children of our country  but would that it might be so
387,its actually a big deal for the current congressional majority to do something nice however small it is im surprised mitch or a paul didnt torpedo it senator duckworth is a true hero
388,well i guess children in congress are okay gail but we need to work on allowing congress to be fully armed on the floor  true given the canewhipping incident you mentioned carrying iron could lead to some destructive behavior  this could get to be a little dangerous when the kids get a hold of those locked and loaded gunsbrbrnow about day care  i assume that republican members of congress would need a scott pruitt or ben carsonstyle day care replete with custom oak furniture and extensive security details along with teaching staffbrbrthere was a woman who would breast feed in her office in my group that performed work for our grand government  no one save one man had an issue with it  the one who had the issue became the brunt of some humor  its finebrbrbut well roll out the sitcoms with a child running around congress  it could be interesting  in one episode the kid a cute and cuddly shirley temple type could coyly encourage republicans to do the right thing where they finally relinquishes their obsequious relationship to trump and lead an impeachment hearing  there is joyous panic on the floor a la mr smith goes to washingtonbrbrand then theres the baby that trump holds during his visit to congress during a state of the union address when the baby pees on him  this opens up a lot of possibility  im thinking that we could get it to run for about a season before the real impeachment happens
389,i admire tammy duckworth and have supported her since she entered politics i am so happy that she has had a childbrbras a person who became a parent latter in life and now in my late 60s have two daughters who are in their early 20s i sincerely wish her the strength and patience and support from her friends and family to keep her sanity when she is 72 there are times when the nearly 50 year age difference is difficult to transcend for example they have no idea what it means to use a manual or an electric typewriter  or to need change to use pay phone  or use the card catalogue at the library 
390,i have a political take on applying the title of the opinion piece caution babies voting to a different issue  there has been a great deal of media coverage for another cohort of babies that  is strongly protesting concerns about gun violence members of congress should think carefully about their positions on this issue for upcoming and future election cycles as these babies will soon be able to express their views at the polls
391,could not help but compare senator duckworth with tammie jo shults  both exemplary role models for young women in this country  both nevertheless persisted to gain their rightful place at the table to serve our country with honor and dignity in roles which in the past had been reserved for menbri cannot imagine the courage it took for senator duckworth to not let herself be defined by her disability  nor did her disability stop her from embracing motherhood at 50 no less  she is an amazing resilient woman with more courage in her little finger than trump possesses in his whole body from his orange hair to the tips of his toenailsbrtammie jo shults exhibited grace under pressure in the face of extreme danger when the plane she was flying had an engine explode  she showed without a doubt that women pilots perform their jobs under the worst of conditions calmly and with the same professionalism as their male counterpartsbrboth senator duckworth and ms shults have my admiration  they are women of courage and determination who have fought to not let traditional roles dictate their career choicesbri am glad senators duckworth and klobuchar were successful in changing the rules which will now allow senators with young infants to bring them on the floor of the senate in order for the senator to cast a  vote  it is progress now they need to work on making the cloakroom wheelchair accessible
392,did anyone actually see mitch mcconnell reading the resolution that would allow babies into the chamber he did so reluctantly with jaw clenched viscerally monotonous tone and with all the pleasure of having to chew broken glass  he probably prefers that women all get back in the kitchen where they belong and just shut up   kentucky get rid of this poor excuse of a man
393,if they let ted cruz on the senate floor its only fair that babies go too
394,since when do mothers have rights  
395,the senate is now ready to let babies on the floor for a few minutesbrbrcome come come gail babies take charge of the senate crawling crying and soiling their diapers on the senate floor every time the republican party is the majoritybrbrrepublican babies pridefully promenade projectile puke petulantly prattle they will never be woke climate change denial hatred of education attacks on healthcare attacks on medicaid medicare social security food stamps planned parenthood science facts truth honor reality sighing peacefully only when in the loving arms of the wealthybrbrto cap it all off republicans have lately been nursing at trumps breast the baby party now gropes as well as growls and gripesbrbrbest to get them off the senate floor in november then start the cleanupthe floor has a noticeable odor
396,the next thing you knew theyd be nursing on the senate floor  havent republicans in the house and senate been nursing corporations and nurturing them along to be productive campaign contributors since the supreme court decision on corporate personhoodbrmovetoamend
397,there were also complaints about the possibility of debate being drowned out by crying babiesbrbrtranslation mitch mcconnell didnt want any competition when he throws one of his temper tantrums on the senate floor brbrkudos to senators duckworth and amy klobuchar for prevailing over ridiculous objections  exactly what is wrong with breastfeeding on the senate floor  its the best way to nourish a newborn when the mother is able to do so  just more archaic rules and regs meant to keep the little woman in her place brbrwont it be great to see baby maile pearl return one day to cast her own vote as majority leader of the senate 
398,i am glad we have a real baby for once instead of the republicans doing their best to act like them 
399,and she persisted
400,if the choice is between mining for bitcoin  which wastes hydroelectric power and takes up empty office space  or mining for gold amp diamonds  which is hugely destructive to people and the environment in developing countries  i think we can live with bitcoin mining
401,brto me bitcoin et al appears to be an expensive game a number of speculative people many who want to hide their money are playing brbrthe problem it is only etherial math neat but not worth anything if people get turned off the game by losing money a matter of time i believe because its too much like a ponzi scheme
402,bitcoin is a pyramid scheme backed by nothing and meaning nothing  it is useful to criminal enterprises terrorists and those bent on evading taxes it is not a generally accepted form of currency and it will never be  yes we are wasting huge amounts of economic potential on financial engineering instead of building infrastructure devising new architectural methods and rising to the challenges of global warming rising seas harsh storms and lack of potable water  when the historians look back on us a thousand years hence if there are historians a thousand years hence they will see how foolish our moment in time was  and they will laugh and cry over our stupidity 
403,what does it cost in energy to dig up and refine an ounce of gold  are bitcoins any worse  its important to realize that theyre not virtual dollars but rather virtual gold and subject to the same sort of lunacy as all precious metalsbrthus the main problem with a bitcoin is that its value tomorrow let alone next week is unknowable while its price is much more easily manipulated than is the price of gold or the value of a dollarbrcryptocurrencies have only two utilties 1 you can buy goods or services on the other side of the world without having to pay extortionate fees to financial institutions and 2 tax and law enforcement authorities cant detect or trace the transaction   im pretty sure 2 is the biggie right now although id be happy to take advantage of 1 if the medium could hold a consistent value from contract through purchase
404,you forgot to mention stock buybacks 
405,the unquestioned value of crypto currencies is that they provide an easy way for organized crime syndicates of all stripes to launder their ill gotten millions and billions while making suckers out of governments and the rest of us
406,bitcoin will change government profoundly  with bitcoin people have a choice if they want to pay taxes on income or transactions  if people dont like the government they wont pay taxes  this could cause dissolutions of unpopular governments
407,of course currencies have always been virtual and value never actually is in the objects produced the waste of electricity mining virtual currencies just puts the relations of production consumption and waste that have always been there in that much starker relief havent we always been wasting electricity is producing billions of tons of plastic happy meal toys styrofoam cups and cheap disposablethis or singleusethat really a more virtuous use of resources and labor 
408,bitcoin is a scam and waste of electricity so is most of the electricity used for cellphones facebook snapchat emails
409,cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are difficult to explain no less understand thats the case for many things labeled virtual and its therefore to be expected that many will criticize them as a waste of timebrbrbut this tendency to rebel against something that seems inexplicable should be resisted you dont need to look far for other examples of similar waste around 2005 there was a worldwide ringtone market valued over 3 billion dollars per year how much energy was used to produce advertise sell and distribute these sounds how much energy is consumed by social media whose profit comes from selling advertising would tying ads to bitcoin make it more real more justifiedbrbrbitcoin may have a less than obvious purpose to many but even if viewed as nothing more than online gambling another energy user its right smack in the middle of a long list of very human and increasingly virtual endevors
410,i liked the wider take on us not doing real things bitcoin being one of them
411,perhaps if we actually had laissezfaire capitalism in this country  and the government wasnt in charge of free enterprisey things like power generation and money  bitcoin would be simply yet another form of currency that people would freely exchange for goods and servicesbrbrsince we dont have capitalism in this country  we have a mixed economy with some dwindling capitalist freedoms and increasing socialist controls  then the shrill cheerleaders of statism also known as fascists will always complain about anything that isnt run by the government like bitcoin
412,the mere existence of a currency that is created without an increase in productivity causes inflation wasting resources is just one manifestation of that
413,this article follows the same path as promoted by noam chomsky that the us is more concerned with virtual production than real
414,exorbitant bureaucracy is the biggest killer of productivity
415,hmmm   brbrcryptocurrency ie bitcoinsbrbrsocial media  ie facebookbrbrthe winklevoss brothersbrbrmark zuckerbergbrbrharvards best amp brightest   brbri urge harvard universitys incoming president to consider a heightened standard for undergraduate applicants   the betterment of the planet and mankind
416,producing one bitcoin depends on the region and price or electricity it is in the range of 4k to 7k compare that to your annual electricity billbrbra hrefhttpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryinonecharthereshowmuchitcoststominebitcoininyourstate20171215 titlehttpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryinonecharthereshowmuchitcoststominebitcoininyourstate20171215 targetblankhttpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryinonecharthereshowmuchitcoststa
417,i wonder how much electricity is consumed by algorithmdriven stocks or forex trading both of which are zero sum activitiesbrbrthe economic crux of the matter was summed up by the famous economist jmkeynes who coined the term animal spirits to describe the nature of our entrepreneurial activitiesbrbrultimately the market will decide the economic utility of cryptocurrencies
418,the concern is the cost to produce how many employed etc making a movie employs hundreds of people at least those made by the major companies a similar amount spent on producing bitcoin employs almost no one but may use similar or more energy and what is the bitcoin used for does it then just sit in the hopes that speculation drives up price  paper profits a movie that employs hundreds then allows those hundreds to spend their money thereby supporting even more industries a key indicator for how effective a business is at stoking the economy is the multiplier of that business  that is how many times will a dollar spent on a given business be multiplied through the economy by its employees its products leading to using other products or other labor etc bitcoin does none of that unless it is spent on something and it appears most of the users are purely speculative hoarders no one knows what the multiplier is or if it is actually a divisor or a subtractor to the economy 
419,when bitcoin is finally confined to the dustbin of history it shall be recorded that the only ones to make money out of it were the power companies
420,this article seems to fundamentally confuse economic activities that produce only virtual outputs with economic activities that dont generate much employment  those are perhaps correlated perhaps because virtual outputs can frequently be copied with no additional labor involved but they are not the same thing  id argue the first is completely irrelevant from an economic standpoint except in how it correlates the latter a video game is not intrinsically less valuable than a physical toy
421,id like to know the cost in mega watts and dollars of producing 1 bitcoin
422,in a time of climate crisis i dont understand why a business that makes absolutely nothing useful but that will eventually have the carbon footprint of an italy or a germany or eventually the united states is not outlawed
423,sounds like a lot of carping to me and a very strange approach to economics to say the least  what do you get from a movie  entertainment and distraction but when you walk out do you have anything physical  no and yet there is a lot of money invested in creating film companies movie theater etc  and so on with so many things produced by the economybrbrhow is spending real resources to produce a bitcoin any different
424,the basic concept of this article is bizarre  let the market decide  i dont think bitcoin mining poses any danger and has no need to be regulated 
425,at least levi jeans came out of the california gold rush to make it worthwhile for many people  
426,yes we absolutely have to destroy the earth in order to produce such fantastic products that make modern life possible  the economy over the environment choice fallacy at its most obvious
427,i often wonder how much productivity the us has lost since the 2016 presidential election also 
428,what is mining bitcoin why does it take so much electricity am i the only reader who doesnt understand this despite reading articles about it
429,im curious how different bitcoin mining is from any of the other financially lucrative but otherwise nonproductive computer driven financial services like high speed trading  such activities generate few jobs and worse are not open to individuals or startups at least bitcoin is something that small players can still enter brbri mostly agree with the criticisms of bitcoin mining but i wonder how many of its critics are just upset that the industry such as it is isnt run by wall street 
430,ive participated in these types of exercises before with members of the japanese selfdefense forces and the usaf no matter how we played the exercise always ended with a dprk nuclear attack on us airbases in guam or japan
431,maybe t should rush in first as he fantasized re florida  gulf of tonkin anyonebrseriously now that the olympics are over the door is open for anything 
432,the closer mr mueller gets to trump and his family the greater the risk of nuclear action  lets hope with all we have that our military commanders will ignore any instruction from trump that is aggressive rather than reactive on the part of the united states  we cannot let him start a nuclear war as a diversion from the forthcoming indictments  
433,the main reason why the pentagon does not want war with north korea is not because of its nuclear weapons although they play the primary role in this confrontation it is because of the conventional firepower ie artillery and chemical weapons they have presighted at seoul the seoul metropolitan population as of 2017 was 256 million or the equivalent of the metropolitan populations of both new york city and miami that same year general tilley is correct in his assessment claiming this conflict would be the most brutal war fought since ww2 due to the sheer size of the noncombatant population that lies less than 40 miles from the dmz and has thousands of artillery pieces already aimed at them
434,besides a war starting stray incident mentioned by sec of defense mattis we should be very worried about a manufactured incident especially given the propensity for provocation by the current oval office occupant gulf of tonkin anyone
435,i am struck by the number of military sources though anonymous in this story i get the distinct impression that the us military really really does not want to have to go through with this and given the likely consequences and the fact that practically nobody voted for it im right there with them
436,the prospect of yet another war fought in asia by the united states teems with the chance of quagmire the first korean war the vietnam war the gulf wars and the continuing stalemate of afghanistan all concluded with indecisive results the us has been heavily vested in the future of asia since the end of wwii but it is time to exercise our influence through trade and diplomacy no doubt that the dprk is a serious threat to the eastern asian region but we must cannot instigate another war in which the end goal is undefined once again when will the us learn to speak softly and carry a big stick
437,ok guysif the joint chiefs or the civilian pentagon planners and trump want a war with north korea bring back the military draft and get ready for the massive push back against warbrhey you pentagon civilian planners who create wars what about afghanistan and that endless waryou fools got us in there and now you think that the american public will just greenligjt a major war with north koreabrdont even think about another war pal in 2020 trump will be voted out of office
438,i cant help but think trump is holding off on this until closer to the election he thinks a military action will be his ace in the hole for a november victory but as usual he fails to understand that the overwhelming majority of us would see this as a reckless catastrophe that will kill thousands of american soldiers tens if not hundreds of thousands of south koreans and it will destabilize the world for yearsbrbri honestly dont think military leaders would go through with it they know and understand the recklessness trump doesnt and wouldnt care if he did
439,what does north korea really want i am thinking that they have given up any hope of spreading their brand of communism around the world they have the illegitimate unelected chinese dictatorship for thatbrbrprobably they just want money i would pay them in exchange for an agreement to give up their nukes and icbms kind of like with their cohorts iran but this time we would really mean it brbrits cheaper to pay them than fight wars and lose lives
440,the diplomacy guy resigned abruptly if you dont know what that means youve been living in a cave brbrexpect a strike cruise missiles maybe to take something out next time there is a provocation or expect a ship will sink mysteriously just after a ship to ship transfer in water too deep to understand why  brbra dog needs wagging  
441,the defense of south korea is the responsibility of the south koreans not of the us south korea outweighs north korea in industrial might technological knowhow and militaryaged citizens the south koreans are more than capable of matching north korea in every form of deterrent military strength it is time that we told them to do so stating very clearly the timetable for own withdrawal from this foolish and totally unnecessary big daddy role we are living in 2018 not 1948
442,if the military wants to play at war maybe its time it included america in its plans brbrreinstitute the draft so every man and woman over 18 has to register and be subject to being called up then maybe america will awaken from its rip van winklelike sleep since 1976 and pay attention to where its sons and daughters are being sent and why brbris there a better way to control congress and the pentagon than an involved and informed citizenry you know there isnt
443,american casualties can be minimized by the use of strategic nuclear weapons in north korea  while civilian casualties are regretable it took 600000 german civilian casualties to defeat hitlerbrbrthe last war america won was because we used nuclear bombs  people still live in hiroshima and nagasaki countless american lives were saved and japan was defeated with a peace that has lasted seventy years
444,oh everybody is like that a good fair honest judge is a judge you agree witha bad biased corrupt judge is a judge you dont agree with thats all in this case trump issomewhat unusuallyacting like an ordinary human being it wont continue
445,trump will go down as the worst president in the history of the united states i know when someone makes a statement like that they need supportive evidence to backup their opinion my evidence appears on a daily hourbyhour minutebyminute secondbysecond news accounts about trump and the swamp mates he brought with him historians will be in demand to offer we the people how trump is destroying this once great nation
446,it is hard to imagine trump as he is and has been as a man of principle  i dont think he understands the meaning of the word or for that matter many wordsbrwhile the principled among us do what they are tasked to do trump can only rail against the unfairness he sees when they do not agree with himbrim sure he recalls judge curiels name but maybe not the context in which its familiar  that is the way of trump to put nothing before his own interests  that is why he is not involved in governing or leadinghe is only interested in being the top story off the daybrit is sad to see the fortunes of this country land in such weak and disingenuous hands  at least by now a majority of us know the game and the gamesmanshipbrego is everything and the only thing in trumps world  fortunately the principled among us keep him in check and if he doesnt get the irony at times that is to be expected given his limitations
447,none of this is remotely surprising anymore but even so mr trumps tweet about judge curiels borderwall decision revealed once again the depths of the presidents own selfinterest and his utter lack of principlesbrbrof interest amp possibly worthy of comment but certainly not news
448,im not a doctor or a health professional but could this be a sign of being bipolarbrbrpeople are saying
449,while i recognize that the focus of this article is donald trump it was the quotation by chief justice roberts which most stirred me because he is flatout wrong brown v board of education was judgemade law for which proponents of civil rights are profoundly grateful gideon v wainwright guaranteed to all criminal defendants the right to an attorney irrespective of any defendants ability to pay for it miranda v arizona created the eponymous miranda warning loving v virginia invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage roe v wade is likely one of the most famous examples of judicial policymaking while one of the most littleknown might be the 1984 not 1784 but 1984 new york case of people v mario liberta which invalidated a statutory loophole exempting married men from prosecutions for raping or sodomizing their wives and lest the chief justice forget the importance of judgemade law he might be reminded of his own role in both citizens united v fec prohibiting limits on political campaign spending by corporations and obergefell v hodges which guaranteed the right to samesex marriage in all 50 states the roberts court has produced some of the biggest judgemade laws for both liberals and conservatives so any judge who is deciding whether to use his or her power to reverse a detestable action by the trump administration should be asssured that in doing so he or she would be part of a long and distinguished part of the american judicial system
450,whats the point of detailing all the bad things that trump has done once again  we already know hes awful  and sadly were used to it  trump along with all his flaws has been normalized  listing all the awful things hes done any one of which would have resulted in impeachment for obama if hed done the same still results in a collective meh from other members of the ruling party  i dont think trump will ever be held to account for anything since our expectations for him are already so low  the only answer to the mess that is trump is to vote democratic on election day 2018
451,judge curiel did what a judge does or should do  interpret the law and render a judgement  if trump wins at all its because he wears people out by being contrary and vituperative  he does not recognize what following the letter of the law means  simply because he doesnt care  yes mr trump  your job is very hard because you work for the people and the government agencies are not there to do your bidding
452,of course trump supporters will likely not see this incisive oped piece or dismiss it as biased fake news because of its source ie the failing nytbrbrbut i wonder if there is not a real possibility that the disordered and selfserving thinking of our current president will reach a level of obviousness even his own supporters wont be able to ignore it anymorebrbri could imagine this happening once trump inevitably says or does something that goes too far against his promises to andor the values of his base in his neverending quest for popularity and approvalbrbri am not a mental health professional but even a lay person can see there is enough evidence now to support a reasonable conclusion he is personality disordered and suffers from a pathological level of narcissism and number of machiavellian traitsbrbrit is difficult to imagine trump not ultimately selfimploding due to his inability to cooperate with others accept advice or admit any mistakes brbrthe way he turns on people how will he retain the cooperation and loyalty of others necessary to maintain the false illusions he wants people to buy into about himselfbrbrtrump now occupies a position that exposes him to what probably seems to him an intolerable level of criticism and scrutinybrbrused to buying secrecy this new spotlight he cant directly control is probably fueling his anxiety and rash statements which reveal his extreme ignorance and dishonesty brbrmethinks hope the length truth will out
453,at times it seems trump gets his tweeting points frrom his friends on the tv that direct him toward a theme  but other times it feels like he has an idea but other people help him with the words and conceptsbrbrtrump is president  but just like obama i dont agree with his actions  i dont think i have liked many of the presidents that were in office during my voting years am 54  i even went so far as to announce on my blog that i was running for the office in 2007  but my ideas are more radical than bernie sanders  though i did agree with trumps stated idea of why cant we be friends with russia  but unlike others id try to be friends with every nation and fight pun intended a war on warsbrbrgerald celente  wanted a peace movement  i have been for peace all my life  but sadly the world is still a violent place and peace is a hard things to get done in a world that worships moneybrbrso big wavy hands wall is in the works  when everyone wants to escape to the places south of us we will lament that wallbrbrban guns and hand everyone a flower and tell that is their new weapon  
454,glad to see this judge is waking up
455,so the judge who el presidente described as incapable of making objective determinations because of his  mexican heritage has made one and response from the white house isnothing  another example of how the imposter in the white house is not able to demonstrate fitness for the office  admit you were wrong  not going to happen
456,the sanguine view of judge curiels decision would be that he dispassionately rendered an opinion based only on his reading of the law the more disturbing inference would be he was intimidated by trumps bullying and cavedbras others have suggested he ought to have recused himself from this case and all others involving mr trumpbrof course as time goes on mr trump may work his way through every judge and be left with only mr gorsuch to sit in judgment of him
457,thank you for the accurate description of how a narcissist like trump uses public bullying intimidation and lying to generate public support for promoting his own interests however i think that judge curiels ability to continue to do his job and adhere to principal speaks more to his job security as a judge than to anything elsebrbrits the protection and security of judge curiels lifetime appointment that allows him to thumb his nose politely at trump otherwise hed be faced with the same conundrum most people face navigating along a rocky road of compromises in ones integrity and dignity by attempting to please a boss or benefactor to maintain ones livelihood trump the republican party the nra private businesses for example all successfully use threats of personal intimidation and job loss to stifle free speech and advance their agendasbrbrtrumps personality disorder and its influences merely serves to highlight the public benefit of an impartial judiciary that operates independently and without fear from personal threats or acts of retaliation
458,in mr trumps world nothing is sacred and everything is transactionalbrbryes but even in the domain of transactions hes no great shakes  tony schwartzs mythological creation notwithstanding trump has careened through a rollercoaster career with most of his time spent dragging stakeholders through the mud even now
459,things are calm today because kelly gave trump a bowl of ice cream at lunch the screaming tantrums may return by dinner
460,not surprised at all by trumps behaviors brbrtrump would call the guy who mugs him and sticks a knife in his belly a good great guy  if the guy asked for an autograph on a copy of the art of the deal brbrhey hes a fan great guyalthough a little erratic with sharp instruments
461,when will our media learn donald trumps secret of success  exaggeration and white lies  every southerner and slick yankee salesman learns how to exaggerate or embroider a story to keep enemies at bay rivals off balance and customers salivatingbrbrdonald trumps florid tastes and personality make hyperbole and falsehoods particularly useful for him and in business and politics its the art of the deal you can use a good story to woe potential investors and buyersfool attorneys and enthuse voters a little crazy can empower negotiations or cover up bumbling ignorancebrivanka understands this and plays along jared sort of gets it the media seem cluelessbrbrgood ol boy jeff sessions understood trumps act until jeff faced a prison term for lying to the fbi hope hicks educated at smu recognized donald trumps white lies poetic license ie southern hyperbole to promote his agenda and throw off the fbimediabrbrprior to modern communications systems tv and the internet the south was boring so raconteurs learned to weave tall tales known to be exaggerated or even false for entertainment or ulterior reasons trump is an adept raconteur shakespeare would hint skillful fool for ulterior motives orange man is a superb entertaining bloviator beloved by his voters and other wits the crazier the more trumps voters love him thus far its kept mueller and the whole fbi at bay its kept kim jong un guessing it may even keep trump from impeachment
462,kudos to curiel
463,having worked in the federal courts in various ways for 30 years now i have to say that donald trump was right to criticize gonzalo curiel almost two years agobrbrthe claims the plaintiffs made in the fraud case against donald trump as opposed to the other defendants were based on sales puffery and were too weak to withstand a motion to dismiss donald trump had the only deep pockets so if he were dismissed the plaintiffs would have gotten nothing thats why gonzalo curiel would not dismiss the case brbrhad the case gone to trial and appeal donald trump would have won the plaintiffs may have been defrauded but it wasnt by donald trump while his words may have been illchosen donald trump was right to criticize gonzalo curiels decision brbrthe federal courts need more criticism like donald trump gave them federal judges have become american aristocracy they are appointed for life they sit on thrones dressed in robes and demand to be called your honor  any one of the hundreds of them can stop even a president from doing his job and no one can overrule their decisions except another member of the aristocracy brbrthats crazy who gave them this awesome power no one they took it 
464,the definition of a good or bad judge does not revolve around whether or not they find in your favorbrbra good judge is one who knows the law and applies it without fear or favor to a set of facts presented to thembrbri guess thats just too sophisticated and nuanced of an idea for trump to grasp 
465,the central theme here is trumps personal and financial interests  in this case he is so eager to be right that a win even over a foolish and expensive wall is more important than his biases  on the other hand had he lost wed surely have been reminded that judge curiel was bad etc  brbrmr trump behaves like a 2 year old and i say that with apologies to children  nothing matters outside himself  no one else matters with the possible exception of his family  he trusts few outside his family hence the rampant white house nepotism  brbrhe has to gloat because his fragile ego is always needy  but tomorrow he may say something else just as with his intermittent complaints about mr sessions one of trumps earliest supporters
466,to say donald trump gets a lesson suggests the man can learn  everything he says and does suggests that is not remotely possible
467,put trump in a room with legislators and it takes only seconds to see that his ignorance is clearly on display the moment of his first utterance for a man who arrogantly boasts of his dealmaking prowess he is easier to play than a kindergartner just flatter donald and he is putty in your hands dare to be a judge of hispanic descent and hell turn your ethnic makeup into the reason why youre corrupt and biased what a fool
468,shorter nyt again we told you so its doubtful that he cares again 
469,oh yeah how about sen john mccain ag jeff sessions and commentator mona charen they have all been trashed in these pages and now find favor with this newspaper as reasonable people look in the mirror today 
470,gee i wonder who judge curiel was referring to in his closing statement half the time i am disgusted that we have a juvenile for president or someone who never developed character so he never became an adult the rest of the time i am just disgusted with the horror of a trump sitting in our oval officebrbrby the pricking of my thumb something wicked this way comes the prologue to his 2300 and counting tweets made as president
471,i find it refreshing that the nyt has finally discovered that the twitter crowd is full of twits
472,being a terribly flawed amoral human being is not unfortunately a disqualification for being elected president  weve had other unprincipled egoists in the oval office though none as transparently so as the current occupant  just because trump behaves like the tinpot dictator of a banana republic doesnt mean we have become one  but the absence of any principled leadership by the congressunless you count putting billions more in the pockets of billionaires as principledis what has sent the country hurtling into plutocracy at home and irrelevance abroad  the only ray of hope in this sordid mess is the capacity in some isolated matters where money isnt the sole driver of policy for lessthansuperrich people to have their opinions heard by the politically powerful  both metoo and the parkland kids are examples of this  i only wish there were more
473,more trump bashing nice picture  get over it  you got 8 years of trump 
474,mr trump is a racist of the first order
475,congratulations to the editorial board for coming up with brain squirt it has all the repellent descriptive power of the more common flatulent phrase while remaining fit to print
476,some 400 pound guy in a bathrobe on a bed in dc strikes again
477,editorial board you have told me nothing new  it is not news that trump swings like a pendulum in his name calling  one minute an individual will be praised and the next minute damned  trumps whirling dervish mind spins out contradictions faster than any nyt columnist can keep up with  my advice is when trump praises someone immediately draft a story about trumps criticism of that person  then all you have to do is fill in the reason and push the print button when it happens
478,as 280character brainsquirts from americas thumbiest commander in chief go the one president trump emitted late tuesday night appeared harmless enoughbrbrthree hags i met in a forest told me that trump would be all thumbs at being president but as macbeth could have told me i would not understand what they meant until it came to pass
479,trump is mentally ill and a sociopath i cannot imagine why anyone would want to work with or for him be married to him be related to him or vote for him hes is a big fat nothing in every sense of the wordbri wish the media would stop covering him just dont cover him at all and see has fast he brings himself into line he craves attention and the more he gets it the worse his narcissism becomes leave him completely alone do not cover him ignore him
480,i do believe trump is regressing in his behaviors actions and comments i used to believe he acted like a 10 year old but now he seems to act like a 4 year old brbryoure my friend youre not my friendbri like you i hate youbryou are very smart you are so stupidbrbrinteresting his nanny hopey just quit largely because of his behaviorbrbrand i thought that course in developmental psychology was a waste of time how old will trump be after 2 more years and how many baby sitters will be required for his aroundtheclock care
481,the proof is in the putin
482,once again the nyt has it backwards the judge got a lesson from trump and learned from it
483,with all respect to judge curiel im against building a wall but his previous tenure as the chief of narcotics  enforcement division makes him the expert on the perils of drug smuggling across the border from mexico  
484,trumps word is as good as walmarts gold earring collection 100 fake next week hell have the nra down to marughlago for a barbecue and shooting range trump doesnt stand for trump any longer there is nothing left of him
485,very bad judg and big legal win tweets from trump re judge curiel whom he maligned as only he can for beingf happens to be we believe mexican  face it trump is the most disgraceful president ever to live in our white houjse and host visitors in our oval office and have 2 other white houses at his dispolsal in nyc nj and fl since when is an ignorant narcisstic braggart considered a public servant in our country  trump a servant  never in caps
486,the imbecileinchief thinks that everything is about him  hopefully any monies going toward the ridiculous wall will be withheld  with such an excess already going go needless military spending perhaps someone will draw a line
487,that is a perfect portrayal of an unhinged president
488,the judge did his job he issued his ruling to his interpretation of the law not because of his heritage this is something trump could never do because he does not understand following the rules obeying the law trump viciously put down the judge because trump assumes everyone thinks like him filled with prejudice malice and revenge trump has no capacity for empathy  with trump its always about himself with his presence he shames america every daybrbrddbrmanhattan
489,trump is a conmanbrbri never take anything he says seriouslybrbrit is a waste of time to analyze anything he saysbrbrwatch what he does
490,first attributing trumps behavior to his mental maladies is falling for his ploy of concealing his criminal behavior with stupidity a mistake many in the media are still makingbrhe is a traitor and criminal he disrupts the us institutions to aid putins group he does so in exchange for russian money received since the 90sbrprosecute russiagate 
491,ok trump was wrong about curiel but were the plaintiffs in this case wrong as well  how was he selected to preside over this matter  did the plaintiffs engage in some forum shopping in hopes of getting him  and did the chief judge of the district court select him because of trumps past criticism  or was it completely random  and did curiel go out of his way to be fair to trump in order to prove that he  was not biased  but no matter  california will appeal  and the ninth circuit will surely throw all the principles that curiel articulated out the window with the support of the nyt and the case will go forward unless scotus affirms curiels decision in a year or so  brbrand of course it is laughable to hear the nyt criticizing trump for not respecting democracy and the rule of law when it is clear that the left has no respect for democracy and the rule of law  why dont you tell us some day how you reconcile sanctuary cities with the rule of law and democracy   and the constitution
492,no worries el presidente will never learn about this because fox wont cover it
493,it was interesting how the media reported on judge curiel during the 2016 campaign they reminded us he was born in indiana so he is an american hes a respected judge therefore of course he will be impartial brbrwhat they failed to report on was that judge curiel is a member of the hispanic judges association he is a board member on the american bar associations hispanic lawyer committee he is a member of the san diego la raza lawyers association and la raza lawyers of california la raza translates to the race  brbrits not exactly a stretch of reasonableness to question whether he might maybe just maybe have a little bias when it comes to issues hispanicbrbrat the same time we followed the case of brock turner the stanford student accused of sexual assault the judge in that case aaron persky also a respected judge was a stanford alum brbrwhen judge persky handed down a sentence that the media deemed to be too light they cried foul out came the villagers with their pitch forks demanding judge persky be removed he couldnt be impartial because of his alma mater brbrtrump is an inarticulate bloviating philistine he seems to be completely paranoid about his public image and is clearly obsessed with winning even the smallest battles but in the words of the author delmore schwartz even paranoids have real enemies
494,with the stipulation that nothing that trump said was anything other than pandering that will be null as soon as the next pretty face or pile of cash enters the room  watching the republicans in the room squirm as the lord of the flies revealed them for the nra owned bespoke empty suits they are was shadinfroidious
495,the whole notion that a federal judge of the united states of america is anything other than well a us citizen was always a ridiculously ignorant and embarrasing to himself thing to say  it also embarassed those who want to support himhis agenda
496,its possible that mr trump simply forgot who judge curiel is more likely he knows full well and doesnt carebrno  he is counting on americans notoriously short historical memory betting that we will not notice yet another instance of his bottomless hypocrisy
497,a legal victory for a man for whom no laws apply the only man in the entire county who cannot be indicted unless he is removed from office first our laws are not blind they are however blinded nixon violated countless criminal statutes and what happened to him he got early retirement with full benefits he left on a helicopter waving and smilingbrbrthere are people sitting in jail right now because they jwalked meanwhile our racist leader lines his pockets as he spits on the emoluments clause trump like most of his party uses the constitution like a piece of charminbrbrhave no delusions and make no mistake laws are for little people not great men like donald trump
498,i never thought i would have an opportunity to praise jeff sessions but i do admire him for having the integrity to refuse to do trumps bidding regarding the fisa court  sessions has many flaws but he appears to have found the courage to try to uphold the past standards and ethics of the justice departmentbrbri wish the media would stop reporting all the baloney that comes out of trumps mouth and his fingers  trumps only objective is to capture all the neon and he certainly has achieved that goal  brbrtrump is the most incompetent crude bullying ignorant and thoughtless elected person in the entire united states  his departure from the white house can come soon enough 
499,if president hillary heavy sigh pulls something like this is the reaction any different than its just don being don
500,isnt the bigliest point here that the judge rejected a challenge by the state of california and several environmental groups to the administrations waiver of environmental laws  brbrwaiving environmental lawsthat to me is the most disturbing thing
501,all authoritarian leaders including those who went on to be dictators started by attacking judges and rule of lawthen they try to bend police and other apparatus of law and order to their will 
502,most other democracies cabinate members are first elected by their constituents and then appointed to their positionsaccountability to the people as well as the boss
503,trump does remember and he certainly doesnt care about judge curiel trump is a psychopath who simply sees everyone else as a prop he can manipulate or a sucker he can gain frombrbrthis is clear from trumps record and it stems from his position of selfentitlement as a rich brat who has always abused the power of wealth that he was born withbrbrso if you help or commend him you get his high praise not because he likes you but because you might do more for himbrbrif you oppose or offend him you get ruthlessly bullied not because he hates you but because he wants to make it harder for you to do any more damagebrbrand you can go from one to the other with the same results  look at how quickly he changed his fickle opinions on mitt romney and darth bannon based on things they said about himbrbrthis weathervane approach makes him a terrible public servant because it makes him personally reflexive to what has just happened and wholly without vision as to what would help the rest of usbrbrironically while the branch donaldians are convinced trump is truthful because he speaks his mind and is not pc he really is more politically dishonest than any other politician because he has zero convictionsbrbrnot yet anyhow godspeed mr mueller
504,march 1 2018brbrwell once again trump needs to learn about our political legal posture and its impact on his imagination that tweets and tweets but would be better advised to adapt to judgment of world class honest truthful journalism like herewith all for the good of doing what is established as needs and acts that are representative of our mature culture and historic antecedents that are time honored and will prevail any aberrations by civil servants in need of refinement for living well smart and safe in our complex worldbrjja manhattan ny   
505,not so fast judges who are publicly criticized or for that matter praised by the president are still human beings whether are labeled us or we think mexican depending upon a decisions effect on to trump brbrit is entirely inappropriate for a president to publicly make personal comments about a sitting judge a president could properly praise a given decision but should not personally praise the judge for making it a president could decry a decision but not the judge brbrtrump does not understand or respect the differences between judicial functions and politics the separation of powers that the founders enshrined are but pearls before swine to trump he treats everything as his person political stage where he can do his act he treats everyone as props upon his political stage brbra  judge who makes repeated or grossly wrong decisions should be removed from office but that is not the president job there is no proper place for public presidential critique of judges themselves where their families come from or anything personal
506,judge curiel went easy on trump wot he the conspiracy to defraud case last time i wanted that case to go to trial and not let trump buy his way outbrit just proved that people with money have special privileges  serious charge like that shouldve had some time served involved curiel chickened out
507,judge curiel would be an infinitely better president than the one we currently have in the white house  in fact there are probably millions of americans who would be better  what a travesty
508,i am not that sure that trump cares mostly for winning or is even sure what it is  i know that what he enjoys the most is fighting and outraging
509,mj questions the times characterization of president trump as commander in chief years ago as a college political science student i learned that our president plays a variety of roles including head of state ceo chief diplomat commander in chief and head of his party other countries do it differently an example would be the united kingdom where queen elizabeth is the head of state and the prime minister is left to focus on most of these other roles the commander of chief role is especially important because we do want the president to command the military and so to hopefully avoid the problems you have in third world countries where the military has a separate commander who can make trouble and threaten to seize power if hes unhappy about something
510,you give the man too much credit for thinking its pathetic hes nothing more than reactionary gloating on pleasure from attention no matter from where it comes and hating all else evident in his offish televised wish  however fleeting until someone else fauns all over him  to remove peoples guns without due process no personal hypocrisy there hes a man who cannot fathom anything past his own ego that is not a brain its barely a bacteria a flu virus mutates quicker than trump can come up with an original solution to anything playing both sides of every argument is not a mind bent upon doing anything its a mind resigned to its own idiocy hes been played by others his whole life which is why hes especially thinskinned and vindictively reactionary to that very notion and resorts to the only thing a feeble brain can devise juvenile insults
511,i was intrigued by the odd suggestion in the article that trump was celebrating his court victory in a bathrobe how do we know that and why should anyone carebrbri followed the corroborating link and found only a yearold reference to a general trump propensity for watching television in his bathrobebrbrthis is not an isolated instance of apparently substantiating links which do not substantiate i am finding it increasingly essential to follow such links and they do not enhance the credibility of times journalism
512,in the very near future donald trump will make reference to judge curiel as an example of how even the judicial opposition is awed and overpowered by his leadership an example of how a bad judge can be made a good judge by watching the president in action  trump is the master at what jim mckay woud call stealing a victory from the jaws of defeatbrbrand now that i have your attention in another unrelated but related article in todays nyt it appears that someone has submitted a forged nomination of donald j trump for the nobel peace prize  hes on a roll
513,laws and norms ethics and principles meaningless concepts in mr trumps worldbrbrthat worldremember is the free from law logic and ethics market  brbrsay anythingadvertise anything especially self advertisingthat will reap a profit bilking others brbrcaveat emptor applies to voters in spades
514,as ej dionne said on npr last week trump doesnt have any values only interestsbrbrtrump also is cognitively psychologically and socially damagedand that is a lot of damage for anyone much less the president of the united states  brbrtrump is  so damaged that he fails to process how he appears to others its either for me or against me the consequences of his often impulsive and selfcentered and selfserving decisions or even why truth matters in his addictive quest for fame and fortune  brbrthus completely lacking in nuance and almost totally devoid of a conscience the egocentric simpleminded and narcissistic trump misses the entire point about ethics laws and precedent and views judge curiel only in relation to trump  brbrand i am pretty sure trump will not grasp the meaning and implications of judge curiels principled and nuanced statementbrcourts are vested with the authority to interpret the law we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments those decisions are entrusted to our nations elected leaders who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choicesbrbrin fact i doubt trump even cares and that is our american tragedy to deal withbut of course the republicans willfully will not 
515,great job skewering trump but im sure he doesnt care he just cares about winning he probably rhinks his earlier criticism of the judge put pressure on him not to rule against trumps wall
516,flipping is one of the markers for someone diagnosed with borderline personality disorder  people who struggle with a borderline personality struggle to maintain emotional connection with people because they either lift people up as good or bring then down as bad  borderline personalities create chaos in whatever group they are apart of  they are unpredictable  they are recreating their own inner chaos  people start to feel the borderlines rage and if they cannot express that rage they will feel depressed  sound familiar  is that not what he is creating in our nation and i suspect in those who work with himbrbrit is a very difficult disorder to treat because if is formed very early on in the unempathetic or unemotionally attuned interactions of caregivers with a notyetverbal child  trump is like a very young child who sees the world as either good or bad in any particular moment  part of me wants to feel concerned and sad for him but it is just so scary to think this when he is in charge of our military and our nuclear weapons as well as the pain he is cause so many close to him and our nation
517,dont we already know that the man has no moral values such old news now what is frightening about this piece is the waiver of environmental laws that are in place for good reason now that is terrifying
518,the bully in chief thinks he won by securing this ruling in a way i wish judge curiel had not heard the case since i think this just inflated trumps huge ego even more he won against the mexican
519,if a democrat gets into office in 2020 id love to see curiel nominated for scotus
520,although you raise an interesting historical irony editorial board any belief if only to the least possible degree that it would somehow be acknowledged by our fake president is tantamount to a trickle of water penetrating ten feet of granite a narcissist is a narcissist is a narcissist to paraphrase g stein
521,a moral victory for judge curiel but an environmental social and political disaster what are we celebrating exactly 
522,go ahead begrudge trump because he cant hold a grudge as long as you can
523,as the crooks in one of will shakespeares plays pointed out if one wants to take over the government and be tyrants one has to get rid of all the lawyers first   unlike donald trump when  over 30 years ago i was sworn in as an attorney i took my oath to support and defend the usa the constitution and the laws upon which the country stands very seriously i still do   in my view trump is a traitor putting his own ego over the responsibility to govern wisely 
524,trump is after all the whole republican party personified  when the rules do what i want im for law and order when they dont ive got all kinds of reasons that they are bad  that includes of course rand disciple paul ryan and smiling mitch  most children by the age of 10 have gotten past this fundamental ethical incapacity
525,dont know whats in the heart or mind of the judge then or now but point of fact it worked  hes president
526,trumps actions and reactions are quite predictable to any child development and maldevelopment professional he is unable to postpone gratification a skill that even young children posses for him his wishful thinking is reality if he wants something he expects to be given it instantly obviously he thinks he is still in a reality show but apparently he was like that even in his younger age he views other people from the point of self whether they are doing his bidding at the moment which may change without  warning he wants to be adored and will buy friendship with gifts thats why at his school he was both a bully but also popular he does not really have a fragile ego his ego is minimal if any at all as is his superego he is all id god help america   3 more years
527,trump is and always has been a con man  the fact that he is now president changes nothing
528,youre assuming trump has enough intelligence to remember it is the same judge  very generous of you
529,interesting it says a lot to be sure which the nytimes has covered well its an irony of collasal strengt but hold on here how on gods green earth did this so called honest judge not recuse himself from this case i might know the answer to this but still liberals of which i am one to be sure are too darn quick to fall on this story as some revelation which it no doubt is for some gain judges like to brag how they are outside of emotion and political persuasion and wear a blindfold when it comes to judgement but there is a reason for recusal and he should have used it its as if he was showcasing his non bias expertise  which if you have one does not need to be bolstered up in the end he would need to rule in favor or else and if he did or else his decision would have been open for appeal  
530,you may be 180 degrees wrong on how this is perceived  rather than assuming that trump should feel chagrined he and his adherents are likely to think that ruling in favor of trump is a direct result of the tough treatment that the judge received during their last interaction  the judge would never want to go through that again heavens no  thanks to trumps tough talk from  now on he will behave like a good judge should  brbrplease nyt if you want to describe the lessons trump with get unfortunately you need to also be able to think like him 
531,in years to come trump and his hopefully one term presidential scandals will far supersede the teapot dome scandal other grant scandals and kennedys nude swimming parties his need for vindication and self gratification are so transparent its embarrassing
532,judicial branch still holding as trump picks away at foundation of democracy
533,here exposed is the conservatives deep state public servants doing their job well here is why you must get involved to encourage our best and brightest to get involved in public service at all levels it matters and the trump gang that cant shoot straight shows why 
534,trump probably thinks he won because he previously bullied curiel  he has no concept of ruleoflaw or intellectual honesty
535,sociology 101 says the first time someone sees information about a topic tends to form hisher views and it takes seven alternate perspectives to change that persons mind  one thing dt does supremely well is to lieearly and oftenand the media picks it up instantly and boom its the canon law to a huge number of our fellow citizens  since it does it over and over and over and over and the media repeat it over and over and over and over of course it takes hold in peoples minds i wish nyt and wapo had a page somewhere far back in the papers that listed what dt said on a given day rather than giving him headlines on pages 1 and 3
536,judge curiel left an easter egg in his opinion as fellow indiana native chief justice roberts observed in addressing a case surrounded by political disagreement
537,one has to wonder what it must be like to be donald trump oblivious and incurious to most things existing in his private gilded sphere where everything he does is perfect and the best and anything bad is not merely excised but erased he is the definition of ignorance of bliss
538,leadership is when you share credit and take blame  the exact opposite issomething else
539,steering the ship of state with trump at the helm is like watching this ship go through the bermuda triangle every daywe are all scared and nauseated and ready for calmer waters
540,another show from our favorite stable genius  one side of his mouth has no idea  what comes out of the other
541,one still cant help but wonder if the judges decision was even a little bit influenced by the bully who would no doubt jump all over him this is one of the problems with an autocratic bully who has no filters his influence on future behavior of others cannot be dismissed so was there some subconscious effect on the decision
542,the president could learn a valuable lesson in public service after his court victory regarding his border wall the judge he disparaged turned a blind eye to the personal insults he received from the president and rendered his decision with a blindfold on the way justice is meant to be rendered brbrif he can stop gloating long enough the president will understand the meaning of the rule of law which means disregarding personal insults judge curiel showed the president exactly how american jurisprudence should work 
543,what is amazing to me is that trump has about a third of the republican party like nunes and ryan hurting our democracy to protect trumpbrbrand the rest of the republican party stands by silentbrbrof course the republican party just past a tax cut for the billionaires toobrbrsomeone making 75000 will get about 7000 in tax deductions over the next ten yearsbrbrat the same time we will add at least 10 trillion to the debt or about 67000 per tax payerbrbrso for 7000 in tax relief he got 67000 added to his credit cardbrbrmaybe i shouldnt be surprised nunes and ryan have no morals dont care about integrity and democracy and are protecting trump
544,equally if not more disturbing than trumps total absorption in himself and his lack of principles are those people and organizations who turn a blind eye to trumps utter unfitness for the presidency as long as whatever motivates trump results in him taking positions that happen to be favorable to them  
545,just stop the world and let me off  he is malice in wonderland and every single day is a new misadventure  thanks gop  you deserve him  the rest of us not so much
546,arguably mr trump revealed his autocratic bent when at a rally in 2016 he said i will tell you this court system  the judges in this court system federal courtbrthey ought to look into that judge curiel because what judge curiel is doing is a total disgrace ok but well come back in novemberbrwouldnt that be wild if im president and i come back to do a civil casebrbrhe also showed a disturbing amount of repetition for a presidential candidate in his claims of im building a wall its an inherent conflict of interest hesbrmexicanbrthat aura of authoritarianism someone not favoring him is therefore utterly unethical and untrustworthy his belief a judge should be disqualified if not entirely removed if a person being sued had prejudicesbrthe warning signs came earlybrbottom line few women or minorities have been appointed as federal judges by mr trump
547,this is a repetition of a dozen things we already know the substance of the legal decision is ignored there are environmental consequences to allowing a wall to be built along the border but the substance of the decision is ignored in favor of the schoolyard fisticuffs over the local bully
548,i commend the editorial board for its direct characterizations of donald trump  the presidents character is so clearly so bad that to so thoroughly denigrate him seems entirely natural and appropriate  we should never forget that this is the kind of president we have  thanks to the editorial board for continuing to say so
549,none of this will move trumps worldview an inch  even though he probably recognizes that this is the same judge he previously maligned i suspect trump believes that this more favorable ruling is a result of his prior tweeting
550,trump never said curiel was biased because of his mexican heritage he said curiel might be biased because of trumps harsh lingo on illegal immigration coupled with the judges mexican heritage and advocacy on behalf of illegal immigrant latinos theres a differencebrthat the judge has proven his ability to be fair might not surprise anyone but lets not pretend trumps concerns at the time were illegitimate if way past timely concerns over judge and jury impartiality play out every day in this country the onus very clearly was on the judge given the soft spot in his heart for illegal immigrants many with clear minds have no trouble seeing a possible conflict but politics dictates whether one sees trumps concerns as racist or just normal everyday legal maneuvering
551,its possible that mr trump simply forgot who judge curiel is more likely he knows full well and doesnt carebrid say he finds it embarrassing and as he has demonstrated in the past  he will ignore it completely because recognizing it would meanbr1 being wrong on his character assessment of the judgebr2 he learns from it and publicly acknowledges his error in judgementbr3 a desire to better yourself as a personbri genuinely feel there is a big portion of trumps supporter who share these characteristics and obamas ability to let the situation and facts influence his judgment is what seemed to them as weak and capitulating race aside 
552,that is one interpretation judicial independence despite the litigant  another interpretation was that judge  curiel was bullied and intimated by trump and it took 101 pages to tilt the law in trumps favor
553,true but the most important thing is that judge curiel ruled in favor of the wall win for president trump as for curiel being a very bad judge trump is correcting that problem by appointing judges to the federal bench who do not legislate from the bench and who interpret the constitution as the founding fathers meant for it to be interpreted not reading better the lines the trump appointees are part of the long range goal of reforming america into that nation for which the original patriots fought and died would they have fought for what america has become i do not know but in the end trump will triumph triumphantly i support the president i support trump thank you 
554,amazingly trumps own sister is a federal judge a member of the us court of appeals for the third circuit even so he rides roughshod over decency and common sense when he has anything to say about the federal judiciary there isnt a scintilla of integrity consistency or truth in anything he says or does and there is no concern whatsoever for the long term stability of our democracy to mr trump its all about what he has to do or say to gain todays advantage petty as it may be
555,i do not agree with the effects of this border wall ruling though i must admit that i have not read it  but i do respect the courts in their difficult task of finding consistent fair law  in this a judge is charged with the duty of transcending personality and ego to go beyond the moment to see the whole  this standard is something trump has completely forsaken and has probably not understood at all  trump is a product of a large segment of our citizens who expect trump to be just like them feckless irresponsible  and subject to the whims of the moment  perhaps some of us will take to heart the civics lesson trump has unwittingly given us in his negative way but probably not
556,if this decision which will hopefully be overturned on appeal was motivated by a desire to punish the american people for electing trump despite the overwhelming negative consequences of building the wall then it hardly stands as a good example of public service  more like a judicial stick in the eye to the public
557,agreedbrthank you nytimesbrplease keep him accountablebrprinciples matter
558,perhaps that judge got a lesson from trump and now at least a little is following the law and the constitution not his personal desires  the president has the same first amendment rights as we do some object when he exercises them i dont
559,trump belongs in a nursery school learning how to share the spotlight share his toys and get along with others  and while it is true that its not the role of the courts to protect us from the consequences of our political choices trump did not win the popular vote  he won the electoral college and that college failed in its mission to prevent a supremely unqualified dishonest and impulsive man from winning the presidency  
560,this allconsuming selfinterest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that momentbrlaws and norms ethics and principles meaningless concepts in mr trumps world nothing is sacred and everything is transactional  excellent description  but ny times editorial board please keep in mind this observation when announcing any change in trumps opinion about gun control  any change for the better is welcome but from someone you have just described in seemingly endless reminder  regarding that proof of the pudding im waiting to eat
561,courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments  it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choicesbrbrtruebrpeople always get the government they deserve 
562,this is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for reelection the same day he was inauguratedbrevery politician understands that winning is a prerequisite for governing winning elections is their primary objective trump is in no way remarkable for this 
563,i accept the diversity of human beings that make up our world most people exist with 5 basic emotions anger fear joysadness grief worry although from time to time i have encountered some that only seem to express two guilt and jealousy trump is one of those and he is our presidentbrbrwe know what trump is but more to the point why does he still have so many that support him and i dare say even love and admire him it seems to me that this is the most relevant question that must be figured out or we will never rid ourselves of this cracker and we desperately need to define what is america of tomorrow and what it means to be an american in a context that reflects our evolving diversity the influence of globalization and the ebb and flow of expantion and contraction of our dreamsbrwhat we cannot let happen is to ever allow trump to get inside our humanity and turn us into fearful hate mongering racist jealous trolls the future of america is not turning inward and rolling back the clock it is to fearlessly reach out
564,yet another article of some length which covers in detail one idiocy of trump i suggest that the nyt covers each of the many such items as single paragraphs in one article and devotes the rest of the papers coverage to the usa and world items that could keep the readers more informed
565,donald trump is one damaged man empathy is 5 on a card cabinet meetings are conducted  north korean style with praise for dear leader school shootings turn into his personal fantasy of being a superherobrlife for the donald is has and always will be about him the greatest most brilliant and successful man ever born in the history of the universe the gop and his base have embraced this ideology wholeheartedly the donald stages rallies across our fair land to receive the adulationbrthis monumental ego has driven trump to believe that his special place in the world entitles him to act in any way he pleases rules laws ethics and respect for anyone else are not required and do not apply to him and he has gotten away with this for his entire life because he was born with freds moneybrtrump has never been held accountable for any of his actions or words try that and he and roy cohen used scorched earth legal tactics to bully and slander any foe apparently jeff sessions didnt get the memo and trump hates him for not being his personal pit bull at the doj its no fun being potus with all the power if you cant go after your foe with malice cruelty and a vengeful heartbrat 71 there are no lessons for donald trump he is a malignant narcissist who can not hear or learn respect or love its all about him 247365
566,trump only cares about one thing  trump
567,i know it is cathartic to express this kind of stuff but we are more than 5 years into the nationally political donald trump we know what a lowlife he is new yorkers have been burdened with the guy for much longer it is now time to focus on his deeds his actions as president if he does something horrible call him on it if he does or has done something impeachable impeach him if he somehow lasts until 2020 vote him outbrbrtake all the emotional energy and focus it on deeds actions and mobilizing in opposition
568,judge gonzalo curiel native of indiana so he is both mexican and indian brbrfurthermore he seems like a very good professional and working for the governmentbrbri am completely lost at least tax cuts will correct all this
569,to understand how the conmans pea brain works listen to wnycs amp propublicas trump inc podcast a recent episode had abraham wallach the executive vp for acquisitions amp finance for the conman from 19912002 while he has numerous criminal convictions himself he had interesting tales to tell about the cheeto von tweeto amp how he works his deals
570, i could settle that case  i dont want to settle the case because you know what because im a man of principle brbrthese are my principles if you dont like them i have others  groucho marx
571,sorry luettgen it is painfully obvious sessions isnt going anywhere apparently he has integrity you might want to add this word to your vocabulary once you figure out what it means
572,the president doesnt care about the rule of law or debate or due processbrhe has proved time and time again that he wants one thing onlybrloyaltybron top of being a white supremacist compulsive liar and a bully all documented the donald is a spoiled rotten 6 year old who never readsbrhe tweets and watches fox and friendsbrif you agree with him he loves youbrif you disagree with him he will smear you
573,i guess in trumpworld it still is all about if you side with him or not explains why he defended the white supremists in charlottesville i doubt he is really a white supremist second amendment devotee or out and out racist he is just opposed to anyone who might be a threat to his image of himself as the greatest mohammed ali aka cassius clay at least worked for the title trump just thinks his presence earns him the title
574,when will this corrupt fraud get removed from office
575,all true and should be pointed out and criticizedbrbrbut its like shouting at wall when you deal with the whiner in chiefbrbrpoor meek mild america needed a thug to stop those mean other countries from picking on thembrbrturned out well so far
576,congressional republican leadership are spineless and dumb   ryan and mcconnell are simply terrible people who will not put our country ahead of their baseless party vote in november america save our country from corruption and impeach as soon as possible 
577,trumps favorite new word is disgrace i wonder what his youngest son thinks about that perhaps that is why he never seems to smile but hangs his had in shame
578,judge curiel showed impartiality the same unfortunately can not be said for supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg in a recent public speaking outing ms ginsburg blamed hillary clintons electoral loss on misogyny im sure ms ginsburgs social and political views never ever rear their ugly heads in her judicial decisionscalling half the voting population sexistvery impartial
579,just another example of how trump cares little for facts and has zero shame in the end everybody even the gop will get burned by him that his way
580,i am sad to say that this editorial is a waste of ink or pixels  just another selfaffirming observation in our own comfortable echo chamber  there are no more intellectual points to be made or emotional succor to be gained in pointing out the obvious our president is simply a bum  brbrwe should be using the times editorial page to move on from calling out the insanity and focus on pulling the country together one small step at a time   identify the narrowest area of national consensus and support the grass roots movements sophisticated enough to avoid taking partisan positions   it only takes one small step forward working together to see the next opportunity  
581,there have always been narcissistic conartists like trump  the part thats hard to wrap my brain around is that so many americans are willing to be duped by a purveyor of snake oil  its selfdelusion on an industrial scale  whether pt barnum actually said it or not its true  theres a sucker born every minute
582,you can bet that rightwing bloggers will contend that judge curiel ruled as he did to escape another taste of the presidents rightful wrath 
583,the dominoes are falling one by one and they will eventually topple trump if he doesnt explode beforehand in a cloudburst from his own natural gasbrbrkushners betrayal of his nation for personal financial gain is merely the latest domino to fall the scandals have increased from weekly to daily to hourly brbrand even trumps attempts to curry national favour by reversing his stance on gun laws smack of sheer desperation like a punchdrunk boxer hoping to land a lucky blowbrbrhopefully trumps implosion will take the entire gop down with him and simultaneously encourage the democrats to rethink their nations priorities hint make infrastructure not war
584,surely the vsg knows that it was his previous criticism that caused the judge to rule in his favor this time no one could possibly oppose him again after that withering attack
585,of course if judge curiel later rules against a case concerning the white house hell go right back to being a mexican aka a bad hombre  political correctness right wing division has its own strict parameters
586,wondering if there is a medication or therapy to help heal a congenital liar one born with that ailment  this is the case with trump  this type of liar will truly not remember his lies  he lives as others point out in the moment  if called on a lie he will deny it  a typical reaction of someone with this terrible diseasebrbrhope hicks sanders and others lie for him when necessary  if they dont they are sessionized insulted frequently or forced to resignbrbrand 35 of the us population love him  gadzooks
587,im still waiting to see a positive comment about trump in the nythe is a flawed human being with who can be turned easily into a caricaturethe times and many of the commentators here miss no opportunity to point it outhe wants to have a secure border and providing it is his dutythe environmentalist and the state of california are more concerned about the illegals than citizens and try phony issues to stop the presidentgood for the judge to take the side of the the lawhope the frequently overturned 9th circuit listens
588,i wasnt surprised that judge curiel followed the letter of the law which apparently wasnt written with powerful fools in mindbrbri was surprised that trump didnt crow that the ruling was due to him beating his mexican enemy into submission  must be saving that for his next rally in texas
589,280 character brainsquirts brbrbest description of trump tweets ever comic and repulsive at the same time brilliant
590,finally we have a president who is dedicated to protecting our bordersbrbrdemocrats will continue to lose political ground if they support open borders and illegal immigration  those who abet illegal immigration like the mayor of oakland should be imprisonedbrbrlook at the tattooed  ms 13 thugs that parade around our streets  why arent these obvious criminals not arrested and immediately deported maybe it is because the local governments are too busy arresting a million people a year for marijuanabrbrlegalize marijuana and use the tax money to build a wall and arrest a million illegal immigrants a year instead of harmless pot users
591,i believe trump has an app on his phone donald trumps mad lib tweets all he has to do is fill in the blanks with the names he despises and hit send  
592,big legal win  and very bad judge   tweets from trump re judge curiel whom he maligned as only he can for being happens to be we believe mexican  face it trump is the most disgraceful president ever to live in our white house to host visitors for the past year in our oval office and have three other white houses at his disposal in nyc nj and fl since when fo we consider an ignorant narcissistic braggart a public servant in our country  trump a servant  never in caps
593,if trumps hamhanded efforts to undermine the judiciary the press law enforcement and legislators and others who have the temerity to disagree with him werent so appalling and damaging to our system of governance they would be laughable  his weapons of choice are insults lies and threats  this buffoon is straight out of a junior high school playground nd yet hes the president  how did this happen  answer  a toxic mix of benighted voters who couldnt get over their hatred of hrc putin a gop who wanted a win at any cost and a feckless democratic party that repeatedly shot itself in the foot br please god make it stop
594,trumps lack of humanity  and ethics are well documented  what is most revealing are the shameless opportunists in congress who support him in order to serve themselves as well
595,to call trump and angry middle schooler would be an insult to middle schoolers how can anyone excepting the tainted gop support this child in old mans clothing 
596,i love reading the moaning pain of americas left   its  delicious
597,when will our ring side view of this very sick man end
598,doesnt matter who the judge is as long as we get that ruling most of us republicans dont care
599,is there somewhere i can read the ny times assessment of judge curiels ruling i already know how the times feels about trump i see it daily on most items in politics and opinions
600,thank you for this piece intersected with my own memories from about the same period when my late wife and i lived in tianjin and i taught at nankai university and she at a foreign languages middle school first 198587 then 199091 w 8889 summer back for shorter visits regular trips up to beijing allowed us time to see many of the places you note the area of  ritan park you describe was a favorite place even shortly after june 6 1989 i think in fact june 79 when we stayed at the ritan hotel briefly in the wake of the demonstrations and killings the area brought a certain calmness that disappeared as we walked toward jianguomen wai dajie i appreciate your memories and sentiments 
601,between 2010 up until june of last year i visited china every year at least once and several times twice for up to three months at a time although i spent most of my time each trip in hubei province studying taiji at wudangshan each trip i arrived and departed from beijing and chose to spend several days in the city i always stayed in a hostel located in one or another hutongs on the west side my favorite park was yuetan where the temple of the moon is located its quite and very quiet  except most mornings between 10am and noon a singer from the beijing opera performed with a small ensemble of chinese musical instruments it was fascinating even enthralling the entry cost was 10 quai about 165bras for the pollution there it varied quite a bit in early autumn and spring the sky was sometimes amazingly clear at the end of november 2015 however the pollution was so thick that after we boarded our plane to leave for seattle we were not cleared for takeoff for about twenty minutesbrbeijing has riches but it can be overwhelmingly bewildering due to its size and complexity two things make it less difficult than many other cities 1 an excellent metro system and 2 perhaps the best airport in the world
602,yet beijings streets walls temples gardens and alleys were part of a carefully woven tapestry that reflected the constellations above geomantic forces below and an invisible overlay of holy mountains and gods it was a total work of art epitomizing the politicalreligious system that ran traditional china for millenniums it was chinese belief incarnatebrbras so once was lhasa and the rest of tibet
603,this is a romantic view of the city one that sells an image not reality  i married into a beijing family and got to see parts of the city that are desperate dirty depressing outdated by centuries secrets unsavory habits and full of every safety and fire code violation you can think of  i really hate it when the government and public only  choose to glorify the pretty historical images  and not the reality of how human behavior is shaped and shaping the reality of day to day living  
604,i work with chinese in film and technology they are so industrious and full of knowledge unlike americans with whom ive worked one won an emmy but the demand for them is so great they travel the world always ending up in beijing the emails and dropboxed films and schematics stop no facebook no discussions of politics then after a year or three they return to me in nyc emails dropboxes lots of working lots of breathing air that is not grey but never a discussion on china or politics i have met their visiting parents who always bring beautiful gifts in beautiful gift wrapping we bow we joke about trump they laugh but these adultchildren are again in demand i have to fight for their talent and work ethics as for beijing all they will say is cant see or breathe they teach at universities when there and freelance for companies one announced that she had married when home her husband was in beijing while she traveled incessantly another the sweetest most beautiful young woman had also been bequeathed by her parents yet we were in love she walked fifteen feet behind me then would rush up to open doors for me she eventually left to marry so no emails no communication a comparison is new delhi the best tech workers home blackened marriages arranged but no communication because the internet backbone was minimal now trump wants these people out no green cards so we marry by choice and divorce
605,the chinese government provides public places where people can worship while america does everything it can to remove worship on public property
606,good to see beijing mentioned  is some other context that high pollution count it is an incredibly cosmopolitan citybrinteresting to see ian johnson search for religion around former temples the chinese do have some form of religion but it is occasional burning incenses before the family altar very common the expectant mother at the temple asking prayers from a monk or back again for an ill baby and always with death as family and friends knell in turn and pray before a picture of the entombed while drums and gongs are played near by the religion is internalized and likely never disappeared even in the days of the chairman it does not require a lot of apparatus 
607,what baloney  beijing would be one of the largest cesspools in the world except its turning into a polluted desert even faster than it has become a cesspool  even the sewage and filth is drying up under the relentless onslaught of drought and encroaching desertification  you can ignore the realities but people who read regular reports on what is happening to the environment and climate worldwide know exactly what is happening in beijing  your city will look like that 4000 funerary garden uncovered earlier this week at the tomb of one of pharaoh hatsepshuts court officials  dead and buried under 50 feet of sand and gravel
608,wonderful city and people but have they done anything to improve the sanitation and toilet situation  
609,thank you for bringing back memories of ritan park  for me visits to the park were a noon time sojourn to a small restaurant which as other comments have mentioned was a delightful place to enjoy delicious meals at incredibly low prices  i recall many of the dishes and particularly enjoyed ma po dofu dong po zhou zi hui guo ruo yu xiang rou si and chie zi  and of course gong bao ji ding  plus bo cai and other delicious green vegetables when we could get them  sometimes challenging in the very early 80s in beijingbrbrin the early 90s we frequently took driving trips with our colleagues through the countryside heading out to badaling moving east toward mu tian yu picnicing somewhere along the way at noon visiting the great wall or not finding new and interesting places and hiking through undeveloped terrain and finally returning to ritan park for a group meal  brbrthe pictures of the tulips surprises me  my first visit to the park was in 1981 and my most recent in 2008  such changes
610,i sought out the altar of the sun when i was last in beijing in december 2015  unhappily i found the shrine completely surrounded by a wooden fence whose locked gate made it difficult to photograph and impossible to approach  perhaps there are times when the gate is unlocked but i was unable to find anyone in the area who might have known  on the other hand id certainly recommend a visit to the nearby dongyue temple and even more so to the magnificent pagoda at tianning temple some distance away the latter is by far and away the most impressive pagoda in beijing but few foreign travelers seem to know that it exists   
611,beijing as a sacred center of chinas spiritual universe lets not get carried away the city was founded  not that long ago certainly by chinese historys standards  by nomadic nonhan people mostly manchus and mongols up in the northern grasslands and plateaus where they manchus mongols felt at home it represents quite a stark departure  in location vegetation and climate  from the long and ancient chinese tradition of setting up the capital cities in the much more congenial south eg nanjing brbrthe weather alone says it all every september local residents will remark cheerfully that tianqi bu leng ye bu re  hen shufu the weather is neither cold nor hot  it feels really comfortable needless to say this comfortable period lasts about two weeks the rest of the year is all about oppressive heat and humidity or freezing but dry cold with the occasional sand and duststorm coming from the gobi desert just to the north thrown in for good measure 
612,nice article that my father who grew up in beijing during the teens through 30s would have enjoyed  i spent four years living in shanghai from 20052009 birthplace of my mother and where the family house still stands  we lived by fuxing park which during the concession era did not allow chinese entrance  when i lived nearby it was full of older people doing tai chi dancing and sometimes singing to old mao era songs  i loved park life in the city  we visited beijing often and enjoyed going to the parks and temples although as a city distances always seemed further than they appeared  you article brings back great memories 
613,unfortunately beijing is also one of the worlds most polluted cities and that doesnt sound very appealing
614,as one who lived in beijing for several years ive speculated as to how much cultural heritage and economic real estate wealth was lost when the walls were torn down in 1963 to be replaced by the 2nd ring road a 24 x 7 virtual parking lot    i believe had central beijing retained more of its architectural integrity the subsequent economic revival of china since 1987 would have  resulted in a cultural heritage similar in scale to paris or amsterdam   there is so much in bj to behold but there could have been significantly more
615,this brought back fond memories  i served in the us embassy from 198689 and also lived in the jianguomenwai diplomatic compound  the city was much as the author described  we were constantly fighting dust and grime but it was still a charming place that had yet to succumb to developers bulldozers  my office faced ri tan park and i often ate lunch in a small restaurant in the middle of the park that no longer exists where a plate of dumplings some pickled cabbage and a beer cost less the 300  unfortunately my last memory of the park was on june 6 1989 when a convoy of peoples liberation army trucks drove down the street between my office and the park firing their guns into the air
616,what a lovely article i too love beijing and especially the temple of the sun i have found beijing the perfect city to balance my explorations in the middle east which seems almost new by comparison exploring china has become a delight and like the writer i have found it quite easy to gaze past the western medias depictions of china as nothing more than a smog hole stuffed with unhappy people and viewed stunning antiquities beautiful countrysides and probably the most interesting and gracious people on earth thank you for a wonderful article that is also a breathe of fresh air on china 
617,i first visited beijing amp much of the border regions in 1985  yes it was hard traveling but people were reemerging from a decade of destruction amp were finding joy  there was little to eat no cooking oil amp nowhere to stay still much of the border region had cultural treasures untouched by the masses  the taer lamasery yangshuo before the tourists the cool yogurt of kunming the breathtaking sunrise on emei mountain  economic development amp the push against tibetan buddhism have exacted a huge toll im glad i saw it when
618,my wife and i were in beijing in april last year and spent an hour or two in temple of the sun park it was the middle of the week and the park was almost deserted  a highlight was the small pavilion at the top of the hill the amusement park along with the restaurant  and beer garden were closed we must missed the antique storebrit was the lama temple which i found most striking as a religious site i wish we had known of the white cloud temple
619,ive been lucky in life  i have had the good fortune to experience many of this planets most interesting cities  beijing is special even among such exemplary counterparts  if you can you really must go  wonderful people staggering history compelling culture and parks no place in the world can replicate  only cape town evokes as many fond memories for me as beijing
620,having lived in beijing for more than 4 years i can relate to the writers effection for the vast and bustling metropolis i was also struck by how beijingers were driven by materialism but at the same time becoming disillusioned by it and slowly returning to religion and other spritual pursuits as always great pictures by adam dean 
621,wonderful article perfectly true to beijing which is a city i am ever so fond of
622,as we head toward the 100th anniversary of the may fourth movement may 4 1919 we should remember that radical antitraditionalism predates any awareness of the existence of marxism and if anything brought about the formation of the chinese communist party rather than being a product of it the chinese are coming to terms with a complex troubled 19th and early 20th century and so are we lets work together to avoid any tragic repeats
623,well ian i sense your affection for beijing but frankly it sounds horrendous a small patch left of what was once a great park and an overweening chinese authority barely in the background shaping everything that remains  much better than in maos day but still pretty bad definitely not on my list
624,not all is well in beijings parksbrbrmost interesting article except that it presents a beijings park in a biased manner nowhere is there any reference made to the omnipresent dying trees due to environmental stress nowhere is there any comment on the pushing and shoving queue jumping that goes on in which any foreigner caught in it is overwhelmed nowhere is there any comment on the army of cleaners and sweepers who collect bottles and papers discarded by visitors yes beijing is grand but in an artificial manner china has grown for the better since my first trip in 1984 do not get me wrong i love china as i made it my area of specialization i am in shanghai on a oneyear sabbatical teaching at a national university and i love every minute of my time interfacing with so many students with great potential unfortunately chinese do not wholeheartedly embrace their history they mechanically live their culture often without understanding it the majority have lost the spirituality that taoism confucianism buddhism and even christianity used to bring nowadays they pray at the altar of consumerism 
625,in lhasa and in tibet in general one can certainly sense the heavy and oppressive thumb of beijing same holds true in much of xinjiang province but travelers can still find much there that is distinctly tibetan  definitely worth a visit and the further you get from lhasa the less youre affected by the harsh political realities
626,if you read the last paragraphs i think you will see that this is not a romantic view of the city  it is actually sad  it is as if the state is trying to resurrect past values and filter them to fit their ideal of what a chinese citizen should be it is a charade
627,citizen x  i imagine there are depressed and dirty areas in beijing as there are in nyc and newark and lots of other metropolitan areas but please specify where those areas are id love to see them in order to experience both sides of the contemporary situation   
628,for most of its history the chinese government stayed out of the religious life of the people now religion is just one more thing to be manipulated to keep ccp in power not so different from presentday american government
629,gary thats one of the consequences of living in a country whose constitution prescribes a separation of church and state  in china on the other hand followers of falun gong cant worship even in private  and the few jews still living in kaifeng a city which formerly had a rather large jewish population have had their one remaining synagogue pulled down by the government and replaced with a medical facility  
630,the chinese government allows its people to worship any religion at any place as long as they are government sanctioned  nice of them no
631,the desert is expanding to the west that is true  global warming if not controlled will approaching the end of 21st c make all of china india and other southern areas uninhabitable but can not lay that one on the chinese alone who seem to be aware of its implications  maybe the capital will be move to siberia somewhere and dc to vancouver
632,janet newton  have you actually been there  beijing is hardly congested with sewage and filth  if a policeman catches you throwing garbage on the street youre likely to do some hard jailtime do you similarly believe that new york is the worlds most violent city
633,   beijing as a microcosm of the chinese universe and for centuries its cosmological center is a given by almost every author on the city chinese or foreign consider wang jun city record or juliet bredons peking the point that china had other older capitals is actually mentioned in the article but isnt part of the articleit never said that beijing is chinas oldest capitalbr   the fact that beijing was founded by mongolians is irrelevant as is the weather what does matter is that it has been the capital of the place we now call china for almost all of the past 800 years as for the south being more typical of where chinese capitals were based this is clearly wrong nanjing was a capital of china for a tiny amount of time for one emperor at the start of the ming and for a decade in the republican era the great historic capitals were overwhelmingly northern cities changan xian luoyang kaifeng and longest of all beijing 
634,it is polluted but not usually to the extent that would impair ones ability to enjoy a visit there  ive been to beijing about a half dozen times and never experienced the sort of atmospheric difficulty that some photos suggest is an everyday occurrence  
635,sorry i have to emphatically disagree although beijing has many nice days and many bad days pollution wise it is very difficult to predict when air quality will be good or bad  making it difficult to plan a trip in the 1980s september and october were characterized by predictably beautiful weather so fall was the prime season to visit beijing now however even september and october dont have predictably good air one of the worst bouts of pollution i remember here in beijing was a few years ago in late october spring is also not dependably good two days ago the air quality index spiked to about 560 or so  far far above what is acceptable by who standards summer tends to be fairly bad muggy polluted and still and late fall and parts of winter are often polluted too last decemberjanuary saw a stretch of 10 days or so of really bad pollution in fact bad air pollution is increasingly common from late october until the air gets really cold  around early to midjanuary so yes you can have a nice visit to beijing if your roll of the dice turns out well but its also very possible that the 45 days you allot for your visit will be be during a stretch of terrible or merely bad pollution even if the pollution isnt hazardous average air quality in beijing isnt healthful
636,i go to beijing four times a year one can have blue skies for a couple days but usually the air is mildly polluted with an aqi of 150 or so that would be 300 in the us or europe pollution can be horrendous in the winter last november i didnt go outside without my mask the whole three weeks i was there you need to be healthy to visit beijing too weve brought over americans as experts to talk to officials and theyve gotten sick even when the air quality is listed as good after nearly 40 trips to china my immune system is strong but i would not sugar coat the air pollution issue its real its improving better than 2011 but still would be considered bad by most westerners
637,excellent comment  some remnants of the wall do remain along with a couple of impressive gates but its a shame that that most of it was torn down in the rush towards westernization  i keep telling people to travel down to nanjing whose city wall is still largely intact but that magnificent metropolis remains chinas most mysteriously untouristed city    
638,how lovely that someone else remembers the dumpling restaurant in the middle of the park our favourite place as children british diplomat parents posted to beijing 8183 as you ordered by number of dumplings jiaodze which were then handmade to order the challenge was to accurately estimate how many you could eat  and after underestimating a few times and wishing for more after the kitchen had closed we resolved to really go for it and ordered 100 in our defence i think there may have been 8 at the table but it took so long to hand make them that by the time the steaming mountain arrived no one was remotely hungry anymore back in the early eighties the myriad parks of beijing were a delight for us  particularly fun in subzero winter temperatures when the ornamental lakes would freeze over and impromptu ice hockey games would appear speed  skating enthusiasts determinedly circling a small pile of belongings surprisingly no official control of ice thickness or access so you might find yourself hopping across floating crates to get to the thicker ice or indeed losing a puck through the dark patches best of all the summer palace lake where you could skate to an island and where an intrepid us staffer i think would ply his windsurfonskates over the greater distances much to the local chinese families bemusement
639,until recently i did not understand the goals of mao and his cultural revolution i believed it was a raw power play in fact it was an effort to discard the heavy burden of the cultural past that impedes the improvement of the chinese society he obviously failed in its endeavour resulting in confucianism and numerous archaic cultural practices coming back with a vengeance for example women are less equal now than during the maoist years parents of the groom need to pay for an apartment and possibly for a car before the parents of the bride accept the marriage proposal i am not a defender of mao but he tried to get rid of the burden of history if china is not careful in addressing this situation the west will remain the implicit role model of the chinese just look at the advertising in china where the vast majority of models are westerners 
640,you definitely raised great points here whitewashing in hollywood fashion and every cultural aspects are simply the legacy of postcolonial world china is the victim of this where people can easily get decent wage just by being white or speaking english but is it the same thing in japan thailand and a lot of countries that were suffered back in colonial periodbrwesterns or i would say white people made the rules of everything we have these days for the developing countries theres not much power to resistbrmy personal thought here which i assume i dont represent vast majority of chinese i am being critical to my own culture as much i criticize western cultural imperialism politically in countries like turkey china russia where authoritarian rules are heavy picking up old tradition often means politicians are ready to take conservative path
641,this nostalgia for events  the cultural revolution  that you did personally suffer through is sad  sad most of all because of the deaths and years of the lives of many wasted brought about in that violent era by maos unwillingness to admit his mistakes such as the horrendous great leap forward famine and share more power with more pragmatic colleagues such as liu shaoqi and deng xiaoping
642,it is so sad what has become of the united states a country that used to create innovate and manufacture now just gives it all all way to ceos and to the grifters in the white house every time i travel i am reminded of how low we have sunk taxes pay for civilization and technology there is no reason except fraud hubris and seriously screwed up priorities that things are like this wish i could be one of those happy fox news people living in my clueless bubble oh wait they are terrified of all the black and brown criminals lurking in the dark oh well ill just hop on the train and hope to get back to bk in an hour
643,i am not sure if anyone is aware but the signal portion of all nyct work is never outsourced it is done all inhouse  the problem with this is that new technology never takes off  older technology stays because the maintenance staff is familiar with it and it guarantees overtime also the newer signal  equipment needs less people to operate   this does not excite the unions a sad state of affairs indeed
644,i have to say as someone who previously lived in brooklyn and has now lived in london for over a decade i find the claims that londoners like the tube and that the mta is dirty baffling  the tube is the most unsanitary public transport system i have ridden due to the fact that seats are covered in fabric appear never to be replaced and the system hosting active drinkers who often cannot control their bodily functionsbradd to that the absence of air conditioning on nearly all lines save a few that operate overground or at shallow levels and with temperatures rising to 50 degrees celsius the system is revolting  the solution of tfl carry water and please do not signal an emergency if you become ill unlike major stations of the mta there arent even fans to move the boiling air around the stations brbras for the signs detailing arrival these are great until your minor delays become severe delays after 20 minutes of waiting  brbri continue to use the tube and other parts of tfl but like most londoners bitterly and grudgingly  
645,americai think is sad to say is fast becoming a third world county  and the trumpet is not the guy to make it great again  hit the road  donald
646,lol its midnight my number 1 uptown just turned into a downtown train the train is reversing back to 125th street  signal failure on the 1 line 
647,kevin hagens photographs are worth a thousand words wow the antiquity of this equipment is staggering
648,honestly this vintage analog equipment is probably far more reliable than anything built today theyll upgrade this stuff at a cost of millions billions and it will be broken and obsolete before they are done with the job
649,they are not doing it right  they are trying to mimic the old system and coordinate the new with the oldbrbrthe need a transponder every 500 feet to know where the train is  have they never heard of gpsbrbri absolutely guarantee you if they sent out an request for proposal to modern electronics companies to supply a system to equip the entire subway system with a system to let them know at minimum 1  where each car is at any time within a few feet 2  its position in a train 3  if the train was moving or stationary 4  speed  with this information software could properly manage the system  i further guarantee that this could be done within a few months for probably less than half the cost of their modernized system which is presumably only slightly better than what they started with
650,as with most of our countrys outdated and often dilapidated infrastructure this problem is the result of setting the wrong prorities over a very long period of time and setting those priorities were conscious choices made by those in public office at all levels it was not accidential  deliberate choices were made against spending on needed projects such as thisbrbrthats why so many of our airports tunnels bridges rail service the power grid the list goes on and on are all in pretty much bad shape 
651,great pix now i dont feel so bad with torontos pace at upgrading
652,yes our subways and railways need their signals to be upgraded  most of these signals havent been changed since i first rode the subways from flushing to my mothers mom and dads on 22nd street and 5th avenue in brooklyn almost 75 years ago  however having spent a good part of my adult working life in a few other countries including japan and especially china i think the bed the trains ride on is at least as important for comfort speed and safety as the signalsbrbri became aware in the late 1900s and early 2000s that the chinese and japanese were getting rid of the old steel rails on wooden ties system thats been used here and there since the middle 1800s and replacing the wooden ties what the rails are attached to with much heavier reinforced concrete ones  i noticed that the ride on some sections of the railroads in china were much smoother than others and i asked one of the train masters at least one on each train  she said to look at the rails  i said i didnt know what to look for  she asked me do you see any movement of the rails i said no  she said that the less movement of the rails the smoother and safer the ridebrbrwe do need new signals but we also need a stronger and heavier rail and tie system  if youre riding at night on a train with reinforced concrete ties sometimes you dont know whether the train is moving or not
653,and why hesitate to invest a few billion   this is a worthwhile cause  have you ever noticed how any time there is a discussion about funding a railrelated infrastructure project people talk about farebox recovery return on investment concerns that the rail agency in question in this case nymta is operating in the red etc  but no one ever mentions such issues when discussing highway and street infrastructure why should our auto roads be considered a free public utility while our metro and intercity trains and railroads are held to tight financial standards  when is the last time someone measured the roi of the cross bronx expwy i95 the belt pkwy etc  they and other highways around the country routinely receive gobs of capital dollars   but rail  thats another story yet shouldnt be
654,how does new york  selfprolaimed capital of the world find itself in a situation where signals wont be fully modernized until 2045 or beyond so many nations which are not as affluent have managed to build and expand subway system light rail and bus rapid transit while we limp alongbrbrrather than grant tax abatements towards largely empty supertall condos perhaps assessing the full tax rate would create a revenue stream perhaps require commercial and residential developers to contribute towards the infrastructure they will affect it may seem a deterrent but for now people want to be in new york enough to make this approach feasible
655,has donald trump ever ridden the new york subway
656,while tax dollars are spent defending illegal immigrants who dont pay taxes
657,this leadoff photo of a control room looks like an outtake from the 1974 movie the taking of pelham 123 the original film not the remake the only elements missing are walter matthau and jerry stiller
658,shanghai has a magnificent underground system as do many other large cities add to that regular and high speed trains networked north south east and west over the whole countrylimited access highways and fine air service as wellbrthis is how the communists oppress their people
659,far more important to spend taxes on new ways to kill people defense than improve peoples lives   insanity
660,the article betrays a philosophy prevalent at the times that the cure for most any ill is to throw other peoples money at it the current signal system has been badly maintained and is causing delays but the fix does not need to be a billion  cbtc install which will be botched so as not to improve service too much or enable zpto fully automatic trains like the airtrain or even opto  one person operation brbrwhat the times cleverly leaves out is that nyct ran more trains at closer intervals and higher speeds a half century ago with far inferior equipment over bolted track todays subway cars can accelerate faster and they run on heavier welded rails and so should run faster not slower and more frequently not lessbrthe difference is primarily the quality of staff and management  todays dispatchers and operators could not duplicate the operations of 50 years ago 
661,so all the new orleans levee inspectors work at mta now
662,i think that the subways are crowed cause of price and the grafity in therebrbrshout out to gavin brazilbrbryour fan bill
663,the taking of pelham 1 billion 2 billion 3 billion
664,the basic structure of the current signalling system is very robust  i think its a mistake to toss it out in favor of an entirely new system  the components all of which were developed before there were any form of electronic controls and which are subject to mechanical failure can be upgraded at a fraction of the cost of an entirely new system  in many cases modern controls would cost a fraction of the replacement parts that need to be warehoused now by maintenance of way  the electromechanical timing relays that work the lights and trippers can be easily replaced with more reliable devices  as can the control panels in the towers  but the existing segment sensors rail switches brake trippers and signal lights which can be updated to leds gradually would be just fine as parts of an updated system  even better this kind of upgrade would not be disruptive to traffic  also remember that a distributed control system like our current vintage one doesnt lend itself to remote hacking  lets not lose that particular robust quality
665,the nyc subway has been a political football between albany and city hall for as long as i can remember   as long as ny state controls the mtas purse strings the subway will be in a perpetual state of 1975  albany leadership also knows that city residents will wont vote them out solely on the issue of a failed transportation system  nyc needs to take charge of its destiny by taking over the leadership of the mta and ending the politicization of nycs infrastructure  
666,i guess we can expect this kind of thing  a failure to maintain and modernize one of the worlds most important transit systems  but really it shouldnt have happened too many people played politics with funding for decades instead of recognizing the crown jewel of the american economy for what it is and its vital importance to the rest of the country not just to new yorkers brbrits the same with all of our aging deteriorating infrastructure  and to see how congress and presidents behave beyond their campaign rhetoric its clear that they dont take their responsibilities seriously and dont understand how crucial modern efficient wellmaintained transportation systems are for the national economy  and that means for the individual lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people brbrthese politicians with their shortsighted thinking remind me of activist investors on wall street  shortterm profits rule and for the longterm well just kick that can on down the road brbrand so here we stand stupefied as that can clobbers us on the head
667,boston is experiencing the same issues with the t  new lines are needed and most stations and tracks need an upgrade i look at all the big multinationals being wooed into boston by our governor and mayor i see all the people streaming into the city to work at these companies but if people cant afford to live in the city and they cant get into the city from the outer towns and burbs then what happens there is never any money for improvementswe keep giving tax cuts to the corporations to get them to come hereregeneral electric et al  i say those companies have a responsibility to improve the transportation in the cities where they roost or else let them take the responsibility to get their own employees into and out of the city for work
668,no mystery why the new york city subway system is in such disrepair unlike other cities with storied underground systems  london paris moscow beijing tokyo  new york is not the capital of anywhere so it does not attract the prestige subsidizing that comes with being a nations capital city good luck with new york city taxpayers voting to make up for niggardliness at the state and federal level
669,could i suggest a small modification there is a problem of attribution of agency in the fourth sentence of the article taking into account the title and subhead which i think you should correct rathe than reading the mtas failure to modernize its signal system is a crucial example you should have written the failure to tax veryhigh income earners to increase investments in public infrastructures including the mtas antiquated signal system is a crucial example 
670,as a londoner i found this article really interesting after living through years of engineering works across the networkbrconsidering most of the infrastructure is 150 years old the tube is incredibly reliable and there is a noticed improvement since work began on the signalling system  i consider myself unlucky if i have to wait more than three minutes for a trainbrthe main problem is of course money we have pretty high fares but transport for london who run the network funnel all profits into upgrades which does help a bit the grants received from the central government are due to end in a few years so everyones fears are that afters several years of progress things will stall once againbrreading about how new yorkers face at least another 30 years of disruption is pretty shocking and hope they are able to put better systems in place for faster progress on future lines personally i think more people need to embrace weekend closures whilst incredibly annoying at the time the words rail replacement bus service bring terror to londoners it will save time and money in the long run good luck  
671,thats what you get with unions no accountability for work performance and poor service at a high cost all brought to you by years of political payoffs to democrats
672,so sad a wonderful citysuffocating under rubble of its own infrastructure brbrand suffocated by politicians whose egos and ambitions came first and they were reelected 
673,sorry folks but mta leaders mustnt be distracted by 21st century upgrades when their primary job is to find meaningless employment for political cronies and their relatives  brbrsomeone needs to abolish the mta and start over
674,were having a regional infrastructure crisis  the old tappan zee is ready to fall down and hopefully can be held together long enough to allow the completion of the new bridge  the tunnels into penn station are crumbling  the mtas signal system is simply too old  but yeah hey lets cut taxes
675,this is what i associate new yorkers with poor subways lousy roads horrible bridges thirdrate airports dirty air polluted water a lot of talk no leadership high taxes poor service no foresight bribes kickbacks cronyism endless whining and complaining 
676,we cannot look at the deterioration in subway performance without also looking at the poor urban planning and zoning which is overloading the system  all the high rises which have been put up along various other lines along the 7 for example  has made getting on the train at rush hour almost impossible  one of our former mayors proposed the solution of removing the seats from the subways cars  that certainly brought up unfortunate associations   i cannot imagine what grand central is going to be like with the additional thousands of commuters brought in from the new high rises going up in the area as well as the lirr which is also being proposed to come into the terminal  has anyone actually looked at the numbers of commuters on the concourse or on the subway platforms now  
677,in my opinion this is largely due to two things 1 the increasing unwillingness of people to pay taxes at the local state or federal level and 2 the growing scarceness of politicians and public officials able and willing to articulate why spending money for the public good can sometimes be a good thing except perhaps when it comes to more pay and pensions for cops and firefighters when  its god bless the first responders time since their endorsements are critical
678,i last lived and worked amongst you 20 years agobrbrthe subway though crowded worked ok then many stations were pretty scruffy not least underneath the pabt itself woeful and soiledbrbri know the state controls the subway but it is quite baffling how one of the wealthiest cities in the world has such woeful infrastructure brbrthe excuse of rider wrath if lines are shut down for installing new signals is just silly obviously its an excuse hiding some darker reality
679,i have lived on the 7 line for 10 years and have watched it slowly very slowly evolve one of the main reasons it takes so long to make any real changes is because the mta barely has anyone actually working if you go through a construction section of the tracks you will see at least 10 mta employees while one or two will be doing actual work the others are eating sleeping in the cranes hanging out in the empty locomotive car they use to shuttle to and fro or a group will be standing around watching one worker turn a bolt or replace a yellow plastic grate brbrive not only witnessed this once or twice i have seen it every single day there is construction 85 percent or more of the workers are never actually working at any given construction site no matter the time of day or night i really wish i was exaggeratingbrbrif the mta really wanted to renovate the lines and deliver a worldclass system to a worldclass city they would hire hundreds if not thousands of workers to get this work done they would also have a high degree of oversight to ensure that each worker is actually doing something brbrhow many times have you gone into a store or a restaurant and saw 85 percent of the employees hanging around looking at their phone chatting or napping not very often because when employees do behave that way they get fired mta workers deserve breaks but not in full view of the public especially given the limited results of these construction projects
680,i love boston but it is an 17th century town with an infrastructure to match strangling in 21th century traffic i know boston fairly well as i went to school there and live an hour away but i loathe to go there the traffic is a nightmare and getting out the way of those antiquated creaking screaming ancient electric trains is worth your lifebrbri dont know how much business they are losing from people like me who used to go to boston often to shop go to museums and dinner but have second thoughts i now go to providence easier cheaper and sanerbrbrcharlie fix the mta for gods sake or ill never return
681,nys subway system is the only system in the world that runs 247 this makes maintenance nearly impossible shut it down from 1a to 530a and add bus routes for those that need public transit during those hours when street traffic is relatively light do the maintenance and upgrades during those down hours
682,instead of grandstanding with free college education for all gov cuomo shouls use those funds to overhaul the nyc subway signaling technology if not so appalling would be laughable updated signaling would improve efficiencies and servicebrthe cost could be shared by government grants and ridership and it require lines to be closed during offpeak times to expedite installation and reduce inconvenience really look at those photographs simply unacceptable
683,forgot to mention that the announcement system is absolutely abhorrent did they not test the audio system beforehand i can barely understand anything the engineerconductor says given theyre speaking clearly because there isbrbr1 too much noisestatic in the announcement orbr2 volume is too low with a lot of staticnoise orbr3 volume is too high with too much staticnoisebrbrthere are rare occasions when its a perfectly clear announcement but 95 of time other passengers and i exchange looks of what they did they just saybrbri may be nitpicking certain aspects of the subway system that do not matter as much as reliability and efficiency but if theyre going to spend money on these systems and displays please do it right its the bloodstream of the city and theres just too much plaque building up 
684,at a few dollars a head multipled by 365  is around 45 billion money coming in each year  they could also raise the price a bit temporarily for added revenue  i think a lot of people would be happy to pay a little more to ride on something a litle more modern   
685,the fact is just five short years ago the reliability of the subway system was much better  take it from this long term new yorkersomething is very wrong  the subway is in serious decline
686,this might sounds heretical  especially from a life long new yorker  but why not consider shutting down the trains for few hours at night in order to facilitate maintenance and infrastructure projects late night partiers and overnight workers would suffer but i think its likely a worthwhile tradeoff for a better run system for everyone else 
687,it galls me to no end that the mta is spending 12 billion to get several thousand lirr riders a few blocks east in midtown while six million subway riders suffer delays nearly every day due to insufficient investment in essential infrastructure this 12 billion boondoggle known as the east side access capital project was not begun by governor cuomo but by governor pataki who by the way is also responsible for gutting the rent stabilization law  
688,i would guess that more riders are upset by loss of cellular connections in the tube than are even aware of the problems caused by the 90yr old train control systems
689,  all human drivers should be replaced by robotsbr2 all tunnels should be painted white which even the cavemen knewbr3  all stations that are one flight down should have elevator accessbr4 the mta needs to maintain  soap  uinknown to this entity except for the super smelly one and lots of bleach and water and scrapping to get the gum off  power washing  always use a machine to do a job which can be done more effectively by hand  does not work and not redecorate train stations  paint peeling from ceilings in passenger waiting areas dirty floors  not to be tolerated but i am sure the kickbacks are much better on unnecessary construction projects such as the one just done at 168th st for the no1 train  the vaulted ceiling simply need washing it did not need a drop ceiling installed which btw put extra weight on the old vaultand cost who knows how many millions as the mta neglected to put up the signage that was in place when the 96th st station was redone  also what idiot makes the staircase step down at sidewalk level  only the 79th st irt station has a handrail to help the handicapped negotiate the step  and most of the stops lack the yellow stripes that tell people something is a wry  furthermore the card reading machines often deduct incorrect amounts  i had a 13 card go to five dollars in three senior tripsbr 5  google trains should not need signals this seems to be old technology  who gets the 
690,everyday i tell myself to make a twitter account so i can rant at the mta directly why is there train traffic ahead of us at 530 am sometimes the 4 or 5 train would have blinking maps or symbols of 23 trains ive been on a d train that had the q symbol inside so many tourists probably get screwed over by all the changes that happen on the weekends and weekday nightsbroh and the arrival times on those touchscreens for the nqrw such as the one in union square are not on time  useless they installed the overhead time displays for certain stations but the downtown 49th street station overhead display can also only be seen if youre directly underneath it because there is another electronic display thats right in front of it that blocks its view did people not think about the logistics when they decided to put that therebrbri have been to cities in asia and europe and nyc has the whackiest and dirtiest subway system making excuses to those visiting i say it has character i understand that its one of the oldest systems in the world and it may not be an easy fix but it has some serious catching up to do the best ive seen is in seoul where trains are without doubt reliable platforms have airport style doors clean usable bathrooms and even a breastfeeding room i dont care for these amenities but at least make the subways more reliable we need to catch up 
691,while reading this article i was reminded of an old family acquaintance who was a staff attorney for the mbta in boston he had a political no show job and didnt even bother to go in for his weekly pay check as he had the t mail it to him for about 25 years different state different time but we all know that there are lots of people working at public service agencies who are political appointments the port authority comes to mind a friend of mine also helped design the metro card system as a consultant and she told me that getting anything done at the mta was almost impossible especially when dealing with unionized employees 
692,the atlantic published a comprehensive article back 2015 entitled why new york subway lines are missing countdown clocks the article documents a few glaring issues that todays nyt article missedbrbrstanding out was the mta incestuous relationship with contractors including siemens where a 13 million pilot for bus times was canceled one year later without achieving anything measurable brbrthe author of the atlantic cited a 2009 report by the mtas oversight organization showing that despite the contractors poor performance on that project ats program managers had been told by their supervisor not to give siemens an overall unsatisfactory rating for fear that this would preclude it from participating in future projectsbrbrthe project was later handed over to a group of mit grads hired to work at the mta bus times were available just months later and the entire system was completed for all of manhattan at the cost of less than 10000 per busbrbrthe mta like all organization is not making progress in many cases because they lack the inhouse technology expertise to complete the projects and are invested in traditional job preservation this strikes at the heart of big governmentfunded institutions the system is dedicated to preserving jobs over providing better service for riders
693,its an old story  maintenance isnt sexy so no one wants to do it  in coop building it results in emergency repairs to unmaitanied systems that cost double or triple what regular maintenance and replacement would  its the same for the mta  theyd rather hire a million  man from london and keep doing it over and over again than maintaining the rails and signals on a regular basis and replacing them on a schedule  as a result its an emergency every day and its expensive not just for the mta but for the people who have to use public transport to get to work  of course thats not the maybror or other top brass who can use a limo or in the mayors case a helicopter 
694,back in 2011 or 2012 a chinese student in shanghai told me she had visited new york city and was surprised at how old the subways werebrbrthey are decrepit because the bottom 90 percent of new yorkers use them while the top 10 percent make all the decisions  throughout the country the same upper 10 per cent have acquired all the increase in us wealth since 1982 
695,i would like to know what is mtas ceo annual bonus and salary compared to his london counterpart of course the whole mta situation might be just an  example of crass corporate mismanagement detroitstyle brbrhad the signal problem existed for such a long time i am sure mta would have found a way to express it publicly and lobby for its replacement or funding i am sure new york times can look into this side of the problem as well
696,give it to the blokes from across the pond to fix  they seem to be better at it
697,do the bigshots of the mta ride in subways or in limousines  from their viewpoint having to transport middle and lower class wage slaves to their jobs is an unfortunate side effect of the banking games that profit them personallybrbrevidence  the high cost and low quality of the transit systems they are responsible for
698,im certainly glad that mr trumps pledge to repair rebuild and add infrastructure is being kept notbrhe is keeping money from californias highspeedtrain line as a punishment for ca going for hillary and to please his rural antitransit supporters who see transit as superfluous or even a luxury apparently  to them everyone lives the same rural lifestyle of a pickup truck walmart being 30 miles away and a full gun rackbrso ridiculous is the money going to the unneeded wall in lieu of the very needed public transit sector 
699,isnt this the story of america republicans hate public transportation so those of us who use it are scorned and the money that should be set aside for repairs goes to new roads 
700,reading between the lines a large part of the problem is the resistance from new yorkers to be inconvenienced  you cant run a subway 247365 and expect maintenance to happen quickly with no disruptions  brbrhere in boston the mbta announced that my local subway station wollaston on the red line is going to be shut down for 20 months while they completely rebuild it before it crumbles apart  the community is furious and fuming but the alternative is 10 years of weekend and night time shutdowns so they have time to do the work  new yorkers are going to have to suck it up if they want to have a reliable subway in the future
701,i only want to echo what others have said about our nations desperate need for infrastructure spending instead weve spend thirty seven years playing economic shellgames designed to engorge the pockets of the wealthy while the rest of our nation and people are left to drift and crumble brbrthink about what these subway delays mean in value lost for businesses new york is one of the major hubs of the global economy and yet employees gamble with delays and lateness every day what does this cost in productivity every year versus the budget for bringing our transit system up to speedbrbrthis is symptomatic of the shortterm thinking that has swamped politics and business for too long the cost and time to fix problems in the present is seen as too expensive the can keeps getting kicked down the road with only patchwork repairs in place thats unsustainable brbrif we want to be competitive and a global leader in the 21st century we need to stop sinking all of our money and talent into the military and the financial industry we need to rebuild our infrastructure in all its facets not only will this create jobs but it will make average citizens proud of our nation again its easier to be optimistic about our nations future were we to see new and updated improvements instead of quick fixes made with bailing wire and duct tape
702,doby gillisis alive and well underground in the ny subwayamazing
703,how in the world can the subway system not have been making a profit ever they have been running the system for way over 50 years not putting any capital dollars into the investment to keep it running and performed maintenance as needed when something is broken not on a regular preventive maintenance schedule does anyone really believe the audits of money coming in and money going out
704,this has been the same issue since i was a student in the early 70s at hunter college we were waiting for the 2nd avenue subway forever money has not been poured into the infrastructure companies back in the day left new york for the burbs because new york could not get its workforce to work on time due to a failing infrastructure i guess the city had a if it aint broke dont fix it attitude most of the major players are dead will the infrastructure ever get better i will be retiring soon
705,these same problems also exist on the subway systems in dc and sf despite the fact they were built in the 1970s transit systems in the us seem to not be run in a manner befitting a fully developed nation 
706,your story missed two important factors that contribute to the subways current condition trophy projects those that politicians can crow about like the second ave subway that only travels 33 blocks and cost state tax payers billions the second is the high cost of labor three times more than it would cost to build or repair anywhere else topped by work rules that dictate progress theres a lot of blame to go around
707,what better example of how this countrys infrastructure is being allowed to crumble and held together with duck tape than the nyc subway system and what catastrophic failure must occur to flip the switch from paralysis to action
708, and yet the proposed solution uses radio signals and transponders every 500ft surely in this day of emerging autonomous vehicles a new train or retrofit system could leverage lidarcamera technology and gps to accomplish this goal without needing the extensive retrofit of the entire length of track if tesla can put semiautonomous tractortrailers on the road surely there is a more stateoftheart solution to this problem
709,i am on the other  side of 80years and remember when the irt had kerosene lamps as head lights  and you know the subway ran better then without the delays and the violence of today
710,the seattle area is working to make its public transit better some parts are now working quite well we live on the north end of mercer island and can get most places rather easily jgaia
711,easy fix for this subcontract new tunnels to the vietnamese and signalling technology to the japanese the japanese built the new metro in delhi india has far more problems than the us but with japanese design and construction discipline built metros in some of the worlds most densly populated cities if you didnt get the tunneling thing the vietnamese had a vast underground system of tunnels that completely befuddled american military strategists during the vietnam war
712,it would be worthwhile to take a single paragraph to explain where the money comes from and where the money goes the mta clearly explains it in their budget 95 billion in labor related costs out of 157b budget transport for london dedicates close to one third of their overall budget to capital improvements given that the mtas nonlabor and nondebt service share only comes up to 24 actual capital expenditure for improvements must be bupkis the real question is what crazy politician will question close to 10 billion dollars in labor expenses to actually improve the situation  certainly not mr cuomo nor any other politician for that matter i would hope that decent journalists would
713,right now they are getting to a point where they will have to take drastic action sure you dont want to upset your passengers but as old as the switching system is what happens if it completely fails then youll have a whole line shut down for who knows how long instead of a station of two for weekends to get the work done i lived in london while they were doing the upgrades and yes it was painful but you learned to work around it come on ny put your big girl pants on and suck it up people will be upset but not as upset if the whole thing goes down
714,run by progressives  i see it somewhat as typical whoever in government runs things does not properly maintain and update them nor do they want to increase the revenues to actually properly do so  a business would be bankrupt if they did these things  folks like to stay in charge rather than do the job properly  now i bet they will be whining for federal funds which they should only get some like maybe 10 of the cost of doing things correctly
715,i dont envy the metropolitan transportation agencys job when it comes time to upgrade nycs subway system not one bit
716,as reported by the daily news today  mta workers walked away with a whopping 1billion of overtime last year you can safely bet that most of this overtime was spent either doing nothing or working inefficiently the whole system is just one big gravy train for their greedy union and the innocent straphanger foots the bill not only in increased fares but in money lost in their everyday lives from not being able to get to where theyre going on time due to the fact that our public transport system cannot have the upgrades it needs not a single politician in this city has the guts to stand up to the twu and end this wasteful greed you know why follow the money 
717,the mta shares the poster for union reform with the teachers union let me emphasize union reform not member reform its very important to split the difference the workers are amazing but the orgs are shady cartels that enjoy cloaks of zero accountability  did anyone else notice that the 2nd ave subway doesnt have a modern switching system why is that true its brand new
718,that photo of the signaling technology is straight outta steampunk  its not antiquated  its totally retro and hip
719,how about modern everything
720,i hate to sound like a tea partier but there is no lack of spending at the mta there is currently about 75 billion in capital spending happening right now compared to other cities around the world thats a ludicrous amount
721,when i visited london for the first time i was very impressed by alerts in underground stations telling riders how quickly the next train would be arriving  this was in 1987   the mta didnt begin installing alerts like these in nyc until more than 20 years later  how is it that it took so long for new york to catch up with london in this area  where have our transit dollars been going
722,what an embarrassment what an embarrassment in 6 years that i live here the ticket has gone up almost 20 and i have not seen much improvement the intercom system is on par w wwi communication some subway stations resemble scenes from zombie survival horror video gamesbri guess until the 1 will take helicopters into the city the rest of us will have to smell trashbrwhat a disappointment 
723,how did these same or fewer tracks and stations accommodate more riders in 1937 than are served today  see ridership data at a hrefhttpsvimeocom93485551 titlehttpsvimeocom93485551 targetblankhttpsvimeocom93485551a   video time frame 0020
724,i have commuted between suburban dc and nyc for the entire 21st century my commute includes the dc metro amtrak and the ny subway it is no contestthe ny subway wins handsdown for reliability it may be old and creaky but it has some redundancy at least in manhattan that provide options and despite its age hats off to the workers who keep it going  the newcomers both the decela and the pathetic metro which is only 40 years old have left me in nomans land more times than i care to remember the metro in particular has multiple disruptions on an almost daily basis despite its promised improvementsand it costs 23 times as much as the ny subway brbrso yes improvements are overdue nonetheless ny subway and your employeesi commend you for doing your best to keep moving despite the increased demand
725,pretty dismal 
726,amtrak which owns the station plans to close several tracks for repairs that will disrupt service this summer on new jersey transit and the long island rail road two of the nations busiest commuter railroadsbrbrtwo of the busiestbrmaybe i am blind but arent the two biggest by farbrcould you please tell me what the top commuter lines are  or update the articlebrbrthanks
727,better call elon
728,the path trains signaling system has recently been upgraded  sure its only 13 stations but it was done by the mtalike port authority and in relatively decent time  there were weekend closures all last year but you deal with it  stay home or take the bus  whatever
729,i imagine there are challenges of colors of money but what fraction of the egregious 4 billion spent on the grandiose wtc transit hub would be sufficient to advance the train control system toy perhaps late 20th century standards
730,in the photo of installing upgraded switch equipment at 34th street there are 6 workers in the photo and only 1 working    no wonder cost overruns and delays 
731,am i the only one writing ho remembers how much worse the subways were from the late60s through the 80sbrbrunbelievable improvements followed these cry baby commenters dont know of the filthy crimeridden graffiti covered trains the grimy dark stations dimly incandescentlit tiles fallen from the walls very scary breakdowns so regular with a 2hour delay between station ac cutting a week daily this train is going out of service another train is following shortly announcements always a liebrbrthese people have no notion how much better cleaner more efficient and reliable the system is now   bright florescentlit platforms retiled with ceramic art crime graffiti gonebrbrnow that is not to say we are in danger of backsliding and after 60 years of nyc population at 7175 million its amazingly now 85 millionbrbris it possible the mta is backsliding into the same pre1985 decay mode of course there must be investigations and fixes do not blame those track workers or unions pleasebrbrand why do signal upgrades creep but weve seen wifi added everywhere in 2 years and train  info signs mushroom overnight what explains thatbrbrthere are legitimate questions all in all though all these gripers seem to have no clue as to how much better the whole system is now that brought new riders and made the city ripe for todays gentrification brbrso sure lets get cracking again but grow up people the trains are a dream these days
732,sadly the problems described here are systemic and you cant stop the trains rip out existing infrastructure and start fresh this is unlike the tappan zee or koscuisco sp bridge replacements where they simply build another one adjacent to the failed structure 
733,there is a very plain reason for the fact that a project to change the signals on the subway system is estimated to take at least till 2045 to be completed and that is that for some reason the ability to build subway lines themselves is something that we no longer have the capability of doing today simply building a couple of new stops on the 2nd ave subway line took years and the plan to extend it in both directions in particular downtown seems to be beyond our capabilitybrcontrast that with the speed and efficiency with which the subway lines were built back in the early 20th century and in addition to the speed in which they built subway lines building subway lines was so feasible back then that privately owned companies funded their construction and competed with each other and each turned a profitbrand this is in regard to subway lines building trolley lines was something that took a matter of a few months just about every major thoroughfare had a trolley line today the city is planning on building a single trolley line to go from greenpoint to sunset park and if things go according to plan it shall take no longer than 5 years to buildbrit is clear beyond a doubt that it is beyond our capabilities to build the subway system today what has changed is not clear but whatever the reason is is the reason that a project to change the signal system on the subway is slated to take longer than the time it took for the whole of the subway system to be built
734,when i was a kid long ago in the bronx the subway was the same crowded smelly sometimes unpredictable noisy and dirty but it opened new worlds new places access to majestic and intellectual things and widened my view of the world to come and undefinable possibilities
735,the fat cat robber barons who run the mta a publicly funded private company make millions for themselves and dont even ride the subway or any public transportation  they continually cry poor while with greater frequency raise fares on working new yorkers who depend on this monopoly to get to and from work so they may hope to afford the ever increasing costs while the system continues to disintegrate  and this is the best public transit system america can present  to quote another prime exemplar of american waste and failure sad
736,while i appreciate that the nyt is highlighting this critical issue i find it odd and troubling that the article makes no mention of the transit workers union or the fact that for some reason the mta requires that the current signaling system be maintained even if a new cbtc system is put in place the two running as a redundant system the mta will claim this is for safety but it seems likely that the requirement to continue using the old system is more about preserving labor that would be eliminated with a new system that required less off hour ot maintenance the atlantic has a good piece on the challenges with upgrading the mta signals which raises these issuesbrbra hrefhttpswwwtheatlanticcomtechnologyarchive201511whydontweknowwhereallthetrainsare415152 titlehttpswwwtheatlanticcomtechnologyarchive201511whydontweknowwhereallthetrainsare415152 targetblankhttpswwwtheatlanticcomtechnologyarchive201511whydontweknowa
737,and yet mta fares are so far advanced
738,the entire system should be operated by a private company with a profit incentive the system would be more efficient state and local governments are incapable of  managing transportation systems because of political influence 
739,i rode those trains for many years i would prefer airconditioning that worked rather than new signals 
740,from an engineering point of view any critical system should be duplicated in the long run and we are here for the long run unless we wipe ourselves out it would be useful for all kinds of reasons to have more choices on subway lines roughly parallel lines so sections can be entirely shut down for repairs and upgrades 
741,one line of thought that is missed here is the role and importance of substitute modes of transportation yes the subways need to be upgraded this is crucialbrbrbut at the same time the burden on the subway system can be lessened by making much cheaper investments on the ground the city has done a decent job expanding bike lanes but it is still extremely dangerous to ride a bike i would love to ride to work but im terrified to do so i know many more who feel the same waybrbrcreating new bike lanes and designing them with safety in mind would decrease demand for the subway by providing a viable substitute and it doesnt cost billions to convert on street parking into bike lanes with proper divisions to keep cars and trucks outbrbron that same topic increase the cost of on street parking and use that to help fund mass transit it is an absurd waste of space to dedicate entire lanes so that ten individuals can park their cars for pennies you couldnt dream up a less efficient mode of transportation brbrsurface land is extremely valuable and should be dedicated to public transit not wasted as private storagebrbrthese are simple changes that can help solve the transit equation
742,your photo titled a worker installing upgraded switch equipment on a track under 34th street says it all  one person working and five simply standing around  if this is the norm for mta workers no wonder the system is in such deep trouble
743,im sure the unions are wholeheartedly supporting change and improvement in the system  democrat city leaders know they will lose union votes if they champion improvements so you the riders are the ones who get the short end  lack of investment in infrastructure seems to be endemic in democrat run cities until it becomes a crisis  whine whine whine but never actually do anything let it become a crisis then blame the nearest republican and ask for a bailout
744,as a midwesterner may i ask what do riders do when a line is closed can they take the bus or what
745,hey thats what you get when everyone wants to come to new york city especially brooklyn and nobody thought of over saturation without updating infrastructure as you go how sweet it is ps plus now you really have a tower of babel going like never beforeoy
746,this rather neatly illustrates the nature and depth of the problem fifty years is way too far out there thomas f prendergast former chairman of the authority said in his final interview before leaving the job in january we have to find a way to shorten that now its a question of  whether the subways will be rendered unnecessary as increasing automation reduces the size of the workforce and the number of tasks requiring human intervention it is doubtful that the resources to literally replace the subsurface and surface transportation systems will ever be available but it would be helpful to recognize this at the outset and realistically assess the politicians wavering commitments before pouring more money into this literal rathole
747,if the citys billionaires  including the one serving as president parttime  rode the subway every day do you suppose maintenance would have been deferred this long
748,where did you get the 6 million ridership figure
749,cities like new york and chicago need to embark on twenty five year plans to move their rail systems out of the nineteenth century preparing them for the twenty second everything from seats to cars to communications and power systems needs to be redesigned ripped out and replaced go at it one or two lines at a time shut the impacted lines down use a bus fleet and blocked streets for the year or two that it takes to complete the work the human race has made spectacular technological progress over the past one hundred years it is time that the population at large was rewarded with spacious comfortable and safe mass transit in the airline industry every inch is reclaimed in the name of profit this mentality needs to end the public has paid and worked for a century of technical advances beyond any imaginable it needs to be rewarded with the fruits of its labor hedge fund managers and ceos will just need to sacrifice one of their helicopters or limos to help fund a better infrastructure for the millions who have enabled their spectacular gains
750,nyc always suffers from the west side highway syndrome  why spend money on huge capital improvements when you can pass it on to the next administration obviously the great age of infrastructure projects has passed and the city can no longer afford the improvements another factor in the decline of the quality of life and the increasing exodus from the city
751,the problem isnt a lack of investmentbrbrthe problem is that the public having made the investment the work was repeatedly not done brbrfunds were raided mistakes were made powerful people needed to wet their beaks they ran out of gas they had a flat tire they didnt have enough money for cab fare an old friend came in from out of town someone stole their car there was an earthquake a terrible flood okay there was a terrible flood locustsit wasnt their fault they swear to gd
752,the technology in the lead photograph looks the same as when the original the taking of pelham 123 was made43 years ago
753,the math in this article proves that the overcrowding problems can be solved with the existing signaling technology  the article states that the existing signaling allows for 29 trains per hour or a train every 2 minutes  if trains ran consistently every 2 minutes there wouldnt be any overcrowdingbrbrwe dont need technology to allow for additional trains  the mta needs better processes either automated or manual to prevent the trains from getting bunched up and delayedbrbranyone that rides frequently knows that once a gap arises eg 8 minutes until the next uptown 4 train at rush hour the situation will keep getting worse  the train arrives overcrowded the conductor cant close the doors and the delay gets worsebrbrthe mta can solve the core overcrowding problems with the existing signal technology  they just need to apply some common sense improve their dispatching processes and deploy whatever manpower is needed to keep the trains moving with 2 minute headways
754,wow  in the lead image of the article i recognized the same control board from the 1970s movie the taking of pelham 123  and it was old thenbrbrperhaps off point the article gives me renewed appreciation for the engineers of the early 20th century  they knew how to build analog mechanical devices that lasted way beyond a reasonable service life 
755,i shake my head in dismay at references to the subway system being overburdened more people are paying to ride the subways  and this is an excuse for deteriorating service that increase in revenue is creating a problem for the managers of the subway system you think macys would bemoan more customers
756,currentky in copenhagen where transportation is efficient and they are adding new metro stations many good models in the world get on it congress
757,by all means eliminate the alternative minimum tax
758,very few on here want to mention the real problem  and neither does the ny tines  the work rukes and pensions for the transit union workers  the executives are a tiny portion even though its popular to blame them  london has good pensions  but as the article noted  they pay much higher fares and get more grants from the british government than ny  you cant have it both ways  each year more and more of the fare goes towards paying ballooning pension costs  that will make upgrading the system even harder in a decade  start cutting all pensions for new workers so in 20 years it will at least be manageable instead of an albatross  shut down the lines completely at night  that is a trade off too  london doesnt run 24 hours so its easier for them  so while it still wouldnt be as fast as london it would be faster than what exists now
759,the politicians are long on promises but very short on action this neglect which has its roots in a corrupt political system is unconscionable and just another example of utter neglect of our infrastructure with the motto the people be damned
760,if it works dont fix it
761,did anyone here ever own a chevette  i had one and it got to be so unreliable that i hated to drive it more than about 10 miles at a time  it did spend a lot of time off line with the mechanic  however even the mechanic was unable to work a miracle with that car  thats what our entire transportation system in the new york metro area is beginning to remind me of  my trusty reliably unreliable chevette  as a result of owning that car i have never again bought car from gm ford or chrysler  everyone i knew had the same complaints about cars from those companies  the abysmal state of the transportation infrastructure is the biggest reason why i never ever searched for a job in nyc
762,not rocket science if you want a new subway raise the bonds to pay for it then raise taxes to pay off the bonds its just that easy
763,this is why remote work needs to become more common tons of jobs that interest me are moving to the tip of manhattan but my everyday ride to soho from uptown was a daily nightmare the f train would stop between stations around 4 times per ride and a commute that should take 45 minutes often took over one hour and sometimes even an hour and a half i cant even consider working downtown again let alone at the tip of manhattanbrbrthe subway system is hampering new york city to an incredible degree 
764,i am surprised by the technology they seem to be updating to  switch sendors every 500 feet why not streaming online gps technology  more accurate faster ie instntanious  easy to update  each train talks to the otherbrhonestly dont need engineers ooops maybe that is whybrbranyway seems like 1990 technology in 2017brmy 2 cents
765,i sure would like to meet the guys who maintain the instruments i suspect they work miracles getting aged equipment to work when even the original manufacturer has long gone does the subway use block signalling
766,hold the phone according to the mta website they have 277 stations currently enabled with wifi at any given moment there are hundreds of thousands of gpsenabled smartphones connected to this wifi supernetwork yet the mta cannot identify precisely where trains are how many administrative salaries does one have to pay to run a network scan and map the locations of these devices am i taking crazy pills does the mta actually employ anyone to think about how to fix this problem or is their solution to do nothing and ask for more and more taxpayer money until a catastrophic system failure brings the tired system crashing down
767,the actual trains should have been updated over the years as the technology became progressively better the use of lighter materials to reduce the amount of power needed as well as computers so that the trains can talk to each other and the main computer at the same time instead the newer cars look almost exactly the same as the older ones if i can read the nyt with wifi on my cell phone the subway car im riding in should contain far more advanced computing power than a handheld device 
768,as someone who regularly shuttles between nyc and london i am glad both systems are thriving in their own ways but face enormous challenges in the short run i am happy for ny that ridership is way up and the mta is viable passenger wise compared to the hell days of the 1970s when riding the subway was dangerous to your life and ridership was plummetingbrbrlondon too is viable and is constant expansion and has risen up to the challenge of overcrowding think piccadilly line at 8am nevertheless comparing the two systems is like comparing apples and oranges london charges fares by zones and it is more expensive than the flat fee charged in ny london does not operate 247 unlike nybrbrif ny wants to resolve the problem they need to bite the bullet and adopt some of the strategies of their british cousins but alas doing some of these things are politically unviable the theater of local and state politics
769,we put up with a lot to live in nyc but everyone has a limit nyc cant really boast about its mass transit when were constantly subjected to mysterious delays and overall decay fares have more than doubled in the two decades ive lived here and i could care less about having usb ports on trains and buses installing an alreadyoutdated technology is an apt metaphor too little too late 
770,i feel your pain new yorkers the mbta here in boston is the same mess even with fare hikes there is zero improvement all that extra money goes to overpaid  employees just like it seems with the mta i gave up on the t after the winter of 2015 although the snow that year was out of the ordinary it showed how unprepared they all were i think the mta should stop worrying about making customers mad they are already mad shut lines down and get something done we constantly have some much to learn from europe and asia in terms of public transport so sick of people in charge not paying attention or caring
771,i was on the wash dc metro this weekend and its neglect and shortcomings are obvious the system is attempting to correct what it can under modern reality constraints line maintenance shutdowns and inconvenience are unfortunately the new realities line segments and stations remain closed for weeks lost productivity and populace relocation are direct impacts and will only get worse the nyc system would be wise to start the suffering
772,it all starts from the top   given the amount of work involved little can be accomplished if we have a governor who doesnt care about this issue and is not motivated to fix it with upmost urgency  if we dont elect a new governor lots of people will not make it to see things changed within their lifetime  cuomo needs to go
773,i have traveled on subways all over europe  the overwhelming majority of trains there are head and shoulders above the dinosaur we have in new york city too few trains run wagons are jam packed almost all morning and late afternoon like sardines people run to get a vacant seat too many delays many announcements are not understandablebrand ratinfested of course 
774,as i rider of both both the nyc subway and the long island rail road i can assure you that a new modernized signal system for the subway system is a horrible ideabrbri know this because the lirr installed a new and very very expensive computerized signal system a few years ago and it is a total disasterbrbrit does not as advertised allow clever workarounds for track switch and power failures  what is does do is take a very long time to get back up when the system fails in any way  in short it was a gift to the contractorsbrbrthe old signal systems put a human in loop when a problem occured  the new computerized systems have no idea what to do when a problem occurs  everything must be restored to the original state to get the trains back into service   and then the entire computer system has to be put through a lengthy series of tests  sometimes this takes hoursbrbryou are not implementing artificial intelligence when you install one of these new signal systems you are implementing artificial spendingbrbrmore to the point the subway system runs at exactly the same speeds it did when first built in 1904  the current signal system is perfectly ok for the antiquated tracks trains and switchesbrbrwhat needs to be done is to rethink and rebuild the entire nyc mass transit system  subways commuter trains and buses  providing arbitrary gifts to politically connected contractors at the expense of riders and taxpayers is not a solution
775,great article informative and timely unfortunately by tomorrow it will be yesterdays news failing infrastructure is the bane of america from highways airports and sea ports to bridges tunnels and yes subway systems all are part of our unseen decline as a country and as a world power we seem to be more interested in partisan politics and name calling demonstrating marching with catchy slogans on place cards what bathrooms we are aloud to use and safe spaces for snowflakes than tackling the issues that will position america for the futurebrthe american electorate had better start to wake up and choose leaders that will prioritize what is important for america as a country right now politicians operate under the banner me first party second country thirdbrtune in tomorrow and see how much coverage is given to infrastructure
776,id like the entire nyc mta ridership to strike for a day to show how unhappy we are with fares and service  im lucky to live walking distance from work but harlem may as well be philadelphia when riding from brooklyn to visit family and friends on weekends  the mta still cries a river every year asking for more money from riders when service and facilities are worse than theyve ever been
777,at some point the people in control of planning these projects will identify the obvious solution to mitigate the inconveniences of closing down an entire subway linereal express bus routes and bus lanes brbrthere should street closings during certain hours to alleviate the need for buses to stop at every cross section etc bus lanes across east river crossings and a massive increase in bus service to offset the subway ridership on these routes brbrit is time to inconvenience cars to accommodate the citizens of this city who rely on public transportation 
778,no stats available on how much time would be saved by going digital or how many more riders would be accommodated would it really be worth the timeexpenserisk digital system would make the system vulnerable to system attack hacking etc keep it analog and just upgrade the analog equipment with more modern mechanisms and parts made from improved materials then even a magnetic burst of radiation wont stop you
779,mta and all transportation administration and planning need to be separated from albany into a regional body independent of new york new jersey and ct state oversight a regional authority with boundaries comprising the metropolitan statistical area that plans executes coordinates and maintains all transp systems is a more rational structure also every position needs to be professionalized read no political appointees an independent audit commission should make annual reports available online to the public revealing all revenues payments and future obligations this entire metro region represents 20 of national gdp it needs a central authority with citizen oversight transparency and taxing power with no revenue sharing to states or cities unless they are investing in complementary transit and building projects todor transit oriented development
780,upgrading the signals with equipment installed every 500 ft as per the article is no doubt a big undertaking but the labor cost and coordination of this undertaking should only be incremental compared to the frequent track work that is done on many of the lines that work requires the coordination of many workers and literally tons of material as track workers are deployed to do their work usually during offhours and weekends why cant the mta deploy some additional electricians to mount and connect the signals required to modernize the system
781,subway cars should have five doors to facilitate entering and leaving the cost of this change is minimal to the increased passenger capacity iemore doors result in increased capacity and faster loading and unloading time during rush hours the system should also reduce express stops gradually convert suer express eliminate local stops with 12mile of each other and more closely integrate bus and subway transportation
782,due to signal problems at union square all brooklynbound trains are running with delays from 241st street to coney island we apologize for any inconvenience
783,in germany i heard people saying that the us is the richest among the underdeveloped countries especially its public transport system whenever i return to ny from europe with its much more efficient public transport and not only in london see the rickety overcrowded and mostly late trains and find myself again on one of the filthy stinking platforms i am reminded of this saying to myself how true this statement is sadly 
784,words in this article to describe the trains and signaling equipment like antiquated or to describe the redevelopment process glacial are really telling i am going to assume its not just the nyc subway that can be assessed with these choice words this country is crumbling it makes the talk of building a new border wall preposterous 
785,i want to agree with this but i have to agree with the comments about where the money goes and how its spent the mta only hit its deadline of opening that first relatively small phase of the 2nd ave subway after being harassed in public about potentially not meeting it there were reports of workers getting drunk during the day in bars near the construction then after so much overtime and working around the clock it all happens but did the overtime send everything over budget its middleground of being a public and private company keeps all the accounting in way too murky territory for it be just be handed whatever billions of taxpayer dollars its asking for i say if anything give it in tranches and have it meet certain requirements before the next one is given out increased ridership and fare hikes should be giving it more revenue wheres it all going 
786,for anyone whos traveled on any other subway system in any part of the world we should be ashamed of the ny subway system  the subway staff seems to represent the condition of the system also  shameful 
787,the system is broken  up and down  its amazing that it still operates every daybrthat alone tells me that it can be much much better  just look around at the stations tracks and other infrastructure  i was amazed to see at substantial completion of the smith9th street and 4th avenue f line stations and viaduct rehab a few years ago that while major improvements were implemented no one removed the piles of accumulated bird droppings that were lodged on the viaducts steel trusses and other structural members  this of course causes significant corrosion of steel and concrete  the guano piles are still there today  these are just the piles that can be readily seen from the subway car  imagine all the piles that cannot  brbrthere is absolutely no accountability  people need to be fired  period
788,the mta is a very inefficient organism cuomo needs to be held accountable for this mess all executives and leadership of the mta should be either fired or their fat salaries cut in half why should we keep paying higher fares that go to the pockets of these oligarcasbrafter a new leadership is installed a new culture needs to be quickly stablished most mta employees dont really understand that they providing a service we are paying their salaries and we should be able to get good customer service they are not trained to provide a good level of service andor are completely ignorant of what that looks likebrthe mta needs to hire consultants and technicians from london and japanbrsome of these mta executives should take a trip to tokyo to see how their system runs they will immediately be ashamed of themselves the japanese know good service and teach their employees accordingly if there is ever a problem in their system its quickly resolved there is no excuses and waste of time this is because their culture is geared to the common good unlike here which is the opposite the mta should aim to create this same culture of service in their employees and their company in general a japanese executive will never accept a salary increase if their system was crumbling like ours this is because they sincerely care about doing a good job and sincerely care about their customers and let them know that most importantly they have honor and integrity in all their actions
789,this along with the equally straining situation with the aged penn station are just two examples of countless many of 37 years of starve the beast  yep  its more important to pour two trillion and more dollars into an off the books illegal iraq invasion and war and nearly half a trillion bucks to the deadend f450 bomber
790,wait a second i thought walt disney resolved this problem decades ago with the people mover
791,there are so many informative comments from readers with a technical appreciation for the subway system and mta labor issuesbrbrid like to learn more about the intersection of unionslabor and the high cost of service and maintenance  brbri understand from other articles that the mta spends multiples of what other transit systems spend to construct subways of equivalent distance and complexity   the question is why  because we wont be able to afford to keep up with london and shanghai if our mass transit improvement costs are 2x5x of what they paybrbra hrefhttpwwwpoliticocomstatesnewyorkcityhallstory201503wherethetransitbuildcostsareunbelievable000000 titlehttpwwwpoliticocomstatesnewyorkcityhallstory201503wherethetransitbuildcostsareunbelievable000000 targetblankhttpwwwpoliticocomstatesnewyorkcityhallstory201503wherethabrbra hrefhttpswwwcitylabcomtransportation2011111billiondoesntbuymuchtransitinfrastructureanymore456 titlehttpswwwcitylabcomtransportation2011111billiondoesntbuymuchtransitinfrastructureanymore456 targetblankhttpswwwcitylabcomtransportation2011111billiondoesntbuymucha
792,at this point i dont even care if they close down parts of the subway during the weekend the summer or at certain times during the night just let us know so we can take an uber bus or bike  at the rate theyre going by the time the fix one problem 2 more arise  november 6 2018 mark the date folks if theres a half decent candidate out there we can make a statement and send cumo on his way
793,trump will make america great again i saw it on a red ball cap
794,between this and the grossly outdated steam system underneath nyc i dont see how we stay competitive in the 21st century this infrastructural disaster cum crisis in the wings is a frightening harbinger of things to come across the nation remind me why we pay such outrageous costs to live here again
795,key to improving subway service in new york modern signals brbrthe infrastructure is outdated overcrowding exists executives are continuing to receive higher salaries relative to the blue collar workersand so on and so forth how about more new trains more money for infrastructure more modernlooking stations and friendlier tickettakers willing to smile once in a while the photos in this feature article appear to look like something out of the 1930s brbrwheres the trumpster when you need him
796,nothing new here we have similar problems in montreal with our metro subway system rates for riders go up each year as the executives pay rises even higher new train cars for the metro didnt fit well and needed to be repaired accommodation for the handicapped is poor with elevators projected to be built by 2020 in some stations for the handicapped breakdowns occur intermittently with repairs taking hours as riders are hardpressed to use busses  and best of all extensions to our metro are to be built towards the french part of town as the english sector of montreal languishes with no extensions proposed
797,this situation is the poster child for everything that is wrong with infrastructure in this country  it cannot seriously be the case that it will take longer to change the signals in the lines than it took to build the lines in the first place   if we fought world war ii this way on the home front wed all be speaking german     hire all the contractors from the london subway work to do the work and get it done  signaling is the cheapest way to increase the capacity of the subway and it does not require boring new tunnels and tearing up the streets 
798,work on one half of a line at a time take the 1 train shut down the uptown track for work and run trains downtown during the morning and uptown after 3pm on the one working track abcd trains and buses take up excess capacity

800,any anti trump propaganda from gaga and my tv goes off immediately and i will never watch the nfl again they hired her and are responsible for any unsavory political speech she may spew
801,ill not watch the sb nor the grammys or oscars  the entertainment complex and that includes major league sports gone allin with the left  same with most live music events  i am done with it all  
802,nfls going to do another inyourface america super bowl halftime show  no election next year to blame another major drop in viewership though  byebye nfl  you chose politics over football and you lost
803,im continually amazed at the illplaced credence afforded poorly or under educated hollywood celebs and professional athleteslike these performers have a greater voice than real americans who have pursued lives and careers worshiped privately raised families and paid their taxes   
804,personally i do not want to see any politics at all during a game from the left or right and none interjected into halftime
805,kaepernick and his fellow spoiled punks was the last straw for me as well as quite a few folks i knowbrjust as hollywood celebrities who think that their opinions are important should shut their mouths and act nfl celebrities who disrespect the flag should get up off their knees and play football i am not remotely interested in their opinions or their causes
806,its easy  dont watch
807,leftist nfl commish seems determined to anger the devoted nfl fans in a seemingly mad attempt to gain favor with the pansy elite class  im shocked at how long the 32 rich white guys who own the teams have allowed him to turnoff their audience and diminish the shield  i guess you can have too much money
808,politics is bad for sports period  
809,i wont be watching just like the rest of the season  i was an avid football fan and watched every game every season until a member of my team took a knee for the national anthem  since the nfl has done nothing to stem this im out  as far as im concerned the nfl is unamerican  i can only hope the players in mlb dont follow suit but decide to play ball and leave the politics out
810,roger should remember who watches football
811,how stupid are they the nfl is already seeing a drop in revenues by allowing the injection of politics into the games and it does not matter if it comes from players or owners  budweiser is already losing customers and the game has not even been played the nfl will be making a huge mistake bringing politics into the superbowl bringing this drama into the game is loselose the only smart thing for the nfl to do is to leave the politics where it belongs  outside the stadium 
812,yes lets all just shuffle this stuff to the side sweep it under the carpet see no evil hear no evil were an american corporation you know were in it for the money not the country brbrtrump you should have lost by 4 touchdowns instead we did
813,you missed mentioning the elephant in the room political aspect of the super bowl tom bradys loudly announced support of trump during the campaign  that will be reason my family of three will leave the tv off on sunday
814,can you imagine roger g making any kind of comment this guy is a total devoted capitalist his only concern is cash flow 
815,110 million people will be watching about 3 times that would watch the oscars and about 20 million more than watched the debates between clinton and trump so if its politics vs the nfl ill take the nfl and the over
816,the nfl is desperately trying to prove it is not part of the liberal media establishment   they have a huge number of fans in the rust belt who voted for trump and who would not hesitate to boycott the super bowl if they thought the  nfl was giving support to antitrump protestors    the nfl is a big business that could be cut down to size pretty quickly if a substantial number of viewers suddenly disappeared
817,plenty of us liberals like to watch the super bowl too but thanks for the heads up about bill oreilly interviewing trump before the game starts listening to an irish hatemonger and a violent mythomaniac exchanging thoughts would make us too depressed to even watch the game well make sure we are drinking our beers with the tv turned off until kickoff
818,i dont understand why a show about four female friends is criticized for its lack of diversity there are some tv shows that show black urban dwellers in their own milieu brbrit reminds me of the times film critics review of the aids film longtime companion that it was about a certain subset of people suffering from the epidemic relatively welloff white manhattanites brbrjust as every film about aids doesnt have to include every group suffering from the effects of the disease every tv show doesnt have to reflect the demographics of this country or city 
819,first i just wanted to say that i expected rude comments because the show has often been polarizing but i did not expect so many misogynistic borderline racist comments to be nyt picksbrthat is disappointingbrbri am probably not the target demographic for girls but i enjoyed it and found certain episodes gut busting funnybrthe lack of diversity should not have fallen on dunhams shoulders but on network honchos who continued to green light programs like thatbri am hopeful because we have strong issues now like insecure and the brilliant atlanta 
820,i do regard dunhams work with admiration girls has been a provocative and entertaining show and she captured my attention for five seasons as annoying as some of her characters could be at times and there were times when i was frustrated by all of them there was something likable about each of them and as a twentysomething living in ny there were moments that i found relatable people love to criticize the narcissism of the women on the show but i think lenas done a good job of highlighting this selfabsorption as a predicament thats quite easy to fall into sometimes its human its not pretty by any means but its real and i commend dunham for shamelessly identifying it by making it drastically evident in her characters i see men attacking the show for it in these comments but rarely pointing out the narcissism or selfabsorption epidemic on reality shows of primped plastic women many who dont even watch girls take the time to criticize the privilege on this fictional series but have no issue with spending hours watching the trivial and staged drama among rich women on half of bravos reality shows hmm
821,just one thing  dunhams body is what is found throughout western art so maybe not so much a recast as a reigniting of our love of flesh just sayin
822,i stayed with the show for 4 seasons and then just felt worn down by the self absorption by both the characters and the writing  and it just wasnt funny  it was however annoying  
823,i guess im lucky but ive never had such awkward ugly unfulfilling sex as that shown on girls 
824,i avoid most tv and would like to see more diversity on what i do watch but i love girls  im old enough to be their grandmother yet find dunham to be brilliant and the other three to be perfect each in her own annoying nailsonchalkboard way  the recurring male characters are all superbly likable and unlikable too  ill greet ms dunhams next project with enthusiasm and i wish her well
825,wow brbrmost everyone in this comments section seems to have brought a grudge to the tablebrbrwhy the heavinessbrbrwe all just need a little entertainment and distraction from what is really going on in the world dont webrbrgirls is one of my favorite shows to watch i find it not only to to be good entertainment but it provokes me as well curb your enthusiasm and baskets in the same league it is not much more complicated then thatbrbrkudos to lena dunham great writing brilliant and fearless what more can you ask for in a television show
826,kudos to the writers of these miniessays they describe the show pretty well too bad the show had so much pathos and very little humor after the first season it started to drift badly the only consistently interesting part for me was the shoshana character the other characters selfabsorption got old pretty fast  and watching women urinate got old too i guess that is an acquired taste 
827,in a way i wish that girls did have a laugh track if taken as straightup comedy especially the dramatic parts its a hilarious show 
828,im a gay man living in the south so im not likely the targeted demographic for girls but ive watched every episode and even when it was maddening it was never too maddening it seemed to skirt that edge ever so closely just when you think it was about to go too far it pulled back i dont know that i love it but i wont not watch it dunham should be proud of her work 
829,i really enjoyed girls and appreciated both how different things are for young women finding themselves and yet how little has changed since the 1980s young women of some privilege who are college educated are expected to more or less independently make something of their lives beyond the marriage plot in addition to the typical struggle for relevance and money women have to figure out sex where it appears they have endless choices but do not i think lena dunhams willingness to show a true body vs the tallish slender bodies of models was both touching and hilarious the portrayal of sex confusion and relationships was refreshing also how many people in our culture want to be artists of some type again the confusion and false starts turns and outcomes this show portrays feel real
830,i cant believe all the negative commentsbrbri so loved girls when i saw it only when hbo offered specials on cable and then i bingewatched i found myself in a familiar environment the weird parties the oh so familiar dinner dates among several likeminded friends the realistic women with contradictions the weird and cringeworthy moments the bodies that are not photoshoppedbrbri thank the new generation of women for so muchbrbras women we exist so much as the silent image that men want us to be lena amy and all these new brave women confront this silent repression of how worthy we are allowed to feel based on how our bodies approach a 10brbrby pushing and enlarging the definition of how women are supposed to look to be successful in love amp work they carve out space for a new generation of women to be able to claim themselves in their relationships in their interactions however how intimatebrbrit is just appropriate that men wouldnt understand any of it
831,all that you say and more  this show has done wonders for my oldest and is likely to help all other girls in my family  for that i am thankfulbrbrto my horror they had been told by important people not us that they should pursue their dreams  because the tenth grade poem got an a star one was going to be a poet and pursue english lit in college  because one had played the thirdtree in a play she was going to juilliard because her coach said she had great potential  brbrthe show has helped me demonstrate that pursuing your dreams is ill advised if one cannot produce value for society and english lit majoring means not having any skills  demonstrate how having opinions sans skills and knowledge is the gateway to lifelong penury  how baysian theory explains that their life would be like dunhams with about about 0000001 likelihood generous estimate brbrnow the older one is studying computer engineering and said the other day that she was going to pursue a masters in systems engineering  i cried with relief  a few years earlier she had given me sleepless nights about her wish to pursue english lit  now thisbrbrive got other challenges  but i am getting my hands on the dvds of all seasons and at the right time sit with my girls  one by one  and explain how this powerful documentary entirely explains the fast decline of opinion rich nonjudgmental middle class america that values pursuing ones dreams at all cost brbrthank you lena dunhambrbrkalidan
832,i gave up on it third season i did not find it funny it was more like the i cant take my eyes off this ongoing car accident attraction i pretty much despised just about every female character and was fascinated by the mens characters adam driver and alex karpovsky made the first seasons  i think it is miscast as a comedy and after watching tiny furniture it just seemed to me to be an extension of that movie a flowers for algernon for lena dunham given lenas book and her book tour it is still hard to separate her from her character hannah horvath however i have watched broad citys two seasons twice and have laughed myself to tears over it every time if that is lenas role of making girlsto open doors to comedy series like broad city i guess then it was worth the time and energy of critical analysis on the now defunct twop
833,thank you for updating me on the lack of progress of the show i binged two seasons of it the first because of the buzz it was getting the second because i feared there was something wrong with me because i hated all the characters and didnt find it funny at all brbrbut that was the shows goal apparently to show awful unfunny people sometimes naked  
834,the biggest downside of hilarys surprise loss was knowing hbo now had no ulterior justification for keeping this stale show going 
835,this was a wonderful roundup of reflections this is one of few shows i keep up with and i agree so much with all the points made in this piece about its unforgettably good aspects and its weaknesses i think of the show as funny most of all but there have also bern some unforgettably moving momentswhat i am thinking of include childbirth and wedding scenes a painfully frank conversations about abortion many fights and slights and the characters enduring willingness to forgive each others pettiness and narcissism because they loved one another the rarest thing for me was the great complexity and specificity each character was grantednearly unheard of in a tv comedybrbreyeroll all the antigirls men commenting here its obviously valid to dislike the show its also great to know when something was never for you and when its not your turn to talk
836,i think people are so worried about being viewed by others as unhip out of it old or uptight that they will praise anything that popular culture tells them they are supposed to praise regardless of how inane how vulgar crude crass degrading trivial or poorly done hence we have a contemporary world of art that is unmemorable that is so fragmented that there is no collective experience that generally just appeals to the lowest common denominator of which in this world of math ineptitude there are many common denominators
837,tried to watch this but it was appallingly flat and gray  too much sex because all of it shared the monotony of being bored sweaty perfunctorybut then it was the same as all the other actions and conversations the characters engaged in trying to be a new waveish interpretation it falls flatonly one wavea onetrick pony  so much self examination and so little to examinetedious and pretentious
838,its great television not perfect however the episode when they watch the play in the apartment complex was excellent theres not much i really like on hbo but im a fan of girls
839,i love the show and as a 50 year old woman i wish lena dunham had been around when i was in my twenties
840,two words  adam driver
841,my wife and are have started watching this series and we actually enjoy it goofy as it is sometimes but heres my biggest gripe about the series if hbo was gonna give us a series that has a lot of nude bedroom scenes featuring a young jewish woman why did they have to give us lena dunham instead of scarlett johansson  thanks hbo 
842,i like comedies about neurotic creatives  and i like cringe comedy   it is time for the show to end though  
843,after writing and directing tiny furniture   a funny offbeat first film which relied on good writing cinematic craft much of the story and comic emotion involved timing and imagery  dunham moved straight to hbo im sure lured by the prospects of audience size compared to her movie and money  then came dunhams book deal i suppose along the way there was probably an actual book for an advance i believe somewhere in the mid 7 figures brbri cant blame dunham for branding herself   achieving fame and financial success   brbrsadly the tv show now lacks most of what was great about the film everyone in the show mostly says what they think boring to watch for this particular viewer and we we see is what we get ie the use of imagery has no metaphoric content besides the flabby skin which works once twice but three times youre out  brbrthe show may be a step down from what was possible for the creator of the movie made years ago and she certainly works hard  nothing easy about churning out episodic tv but artistic thinking is harder  and i would hope she can find a way to move on to fresh ideas   from girls 6 years for goodness sakes  what logically comes next would be adolescence  maybe that would be a step forward 
844,in our 20s there were many women dealing with all these messy issues and the real political world outside  trumps where he is because his narcissism and theirs operates on a similar plane a lot about hair sex and success
845,i think i watched a couple of episodes in season 1  i was a sex and the city fan  girls is not anywhere near as funnier or clever and extremely more annoying   the girls are entitled and have no redeeming qualities in my opinion please do not get me started on lena dunham who has got to be the most selfobsessed celebrity out there for no good reason 
846,our example was  mary tyler moore
847,i am reminded of all the poor people who voted with trump because in a misguided aspiration they identified with him he is one of us they said i find the fake sense of equality of opportunity suggested in the content and praising of this show an insult to the injury of those who seek to live in truth and to act from it in a meaningful pursuit by promoting fakeness this series helps to keep people comfortably numb in impotent slumber and oh ao what a role you have chosen to play in this world thats just a stage
848,the thing that disturbs me about the show is its depiction of what sex is like for women  i am hardpressed to recall any sexual encounters they really seem to enjoy  so many of them seem to involve humiliation and discomfort followed by regret  in that way it seems extremely oldfashioned  women have sex in order to get or hang onto a man or to prove something to themselves even during those scenes in which the characters seem to be feeling some passion sex seems to be more like scratching an itch than anything else where is the real sensuality the real pleasurebrbrperhaps girls does depict the reality of young women today  if so how sad ibrnever get the feeling the women are actually demanding more for themselves its more like theyve just accepted that this is what sex is like and will always be
849,a friend and i were both in our 60s noted at the getgo the timelessness of girls who they were what they did how they felt and how they expressed themselves was exactly the same as what it was like to be a young woman 40 years ago i could be their grandmother but its as real to me as my own era the men are the same same personal and career struggles obstacles ups and downs i can tell the girls of girls that in many ways  it never gets resolved we chalk up more experiences but we never stop questioning ourselves and promising ourselves that well become women well never become in other words  you need a bigger cauldron to hold it all but its still the same soup
850,girls is timeless i am 70 years old and i saw myself and my friends when we were in our 20s struggling to create our lives in that show all of these modern programs i am thinking of the list at the end of this piece are a pleasure to watch and outshine in every way the dreary sitcoms of the past
851,i am an older african american woman and have had a lovehate relationship with girls from the start i have watched every episode and most times walk away shaking my head wondering if all the characters should just book a psychiatry appointment and call it a daybrbrthe show disappointed me in its constant portrayal of rampant self involvement insecurity and selfishnessbut then again thats exactly how we girls can be friendship is never black amp white it has layers and evolvesdevolves over time the girls you knew when you were 18 years old are very different girls by the time they reach 30 and just may turn out to be people that youd rather not be around much anymorebrbri found any episode featuring adam driver or andrew rannells to be sweet reliefbrand yes as a minority i did miss seeing a full representation of new york in the show but i guess im more realistic about that issue and dont go into every viewing experience expecting to see a mirror of myselfbrbrlike most others i found girls to be fascinating annoying amusing grating and revolutionary all at once im certainly glad it made it on the air but its high time to move on to establish new tv relationships with shows like atlanta and master of none that have a different kind of voice and insights far beyond the neurotic messy heartbreaking lives of these 4 gal pals
852,i loved this show pre trump these characters having lived the whole of their entitled lives within the progressive society their parents made for them  without a care for its maintenance seem antiquated and irrelevant now  how things can change in one hiatus
853,lena dunham promised to move out of the usa if trump was elected so did amy shumer and whoopi goldberg when are they leaving good riddance
854,interesting how many of the negative comments are from men i loved this show even though some episodes in the 3rd season fell a bit flat overall i loved the ruminations and processing ones way through the messiness of life the women were smart and unapologetic as they negotiated their way into adulthood and all the while not hiding the blemishes or awkwardness i think thats what i liked the most  its lack of a sanitized presentation of life
855,girls is a pretty good show but far from being addictivebrshameless to me is a way better show in terms of writing acting and production the plots are topnotch and it also shines in diversity i wonder why the nyt writers even dont bother to mention itbrthere may be a deeper connection why nyt is obsessed with girls with how democrats lost the wh do democrats and liberals represents the voice of the working class they thought they do but they suck at it 
856,instead of campaigning in diners in western pennsylvania hillary clinton actually spent time campaigning with lena dunham in north carolina and that shows you just how out of touch hillary was this writer is with most americans girls is an irrelevant piece of junk that will be soon be forgotten
857,i am a female 54 year college professor  i love girls  these are wonderful reflections on the effortless nature of its comedy and therefore the easy to miss brilliance of the show i have always thought that the haters just dont get it best line here its about being white and spoiled and selfconcerned well thats it isnt it  props to the real lena as well like all the rest of us who are outraged and dont know what to do the real lena tends to have a strong opinion about everything maybe even topics she isnt informed on but i say hey girl keep on rocking girlsis a top 5 girls show of all time
858,having watched a few seasons of girls during my senior citizen years i can almost see each of the four characters in an updated version of  golden girls  40 years down the road  its fans will have it streamed directly into their vision and hearing correction devices which they still think no one is noticing
859,i love girls it reminds me of trying to live in a big city together with female friends to keep the rent affordablewe had situations similar to some girls episodesjust hilariousthat was 50 years ago girlsis timeless and i really appreciate the  episodes and the writing and how it is all put togetheri do love it
860,i love this show age 51  it is such a great departure from all the tidy series i used to watch on regular tv back when i do think it seems so realistic with all the human flaws and people just seemingly real to me  although i cant say i actually know people who are like this crew i do see various parts of them in many people i know and love i realize that the actors are all products of privileged backgrounds but that really doesnt bother me i thank them for being courageous enough to bring another dimension of life to the screen for me to watch  goodness knows i could never ever do it
861,love the show  girls  the characters arent idealized  they struggle  they grow   sometimes its funny  sometimes its painful  tv needs more of thisbrbrand its refreshing to see a show that revolves around young women  women who arent ditzes or sex kittens  imagine that  apparently its too much for some men to bear  actually after reading the comments im a little scared by how much anger some men have at this show  makes me realize society needs a lot more shows like girls  the angry men can always return to their safe space by switching the channel to the bachelor or football or whatever it is that they watch
862,i love girls and im going to be sad when its over im a baby boomer but i well remember my years of tumultuous early adulthood and girls updates this perfectly for our times  it seems that a lot of commenter who hate this show dont understand the humor hannah is indeed a selfindulgent narcissist but unlike another narcissist we know she doesnt endanger the world and she has vulnerabilities and sometimes selfawareness that make her human and how dunham illustrates this is amazing and especially very funny  lighten up everyone
863,sure a few shows dragged and the seasons that followed season 1 had an uphill battle but i still loved this show  it was a window into the urbane millennial generation the generation that flocked to urban neighborhoods in huge numbers leaving trump country far behind  if you wanted to know what kids were up to in nyc or sf in 20112017 girls gave an fairly accurate portrayal  i cant wait to see what dunham does nextbrfor the record the nyt commentators failed to mention insecure a new hbo comedy series written and performed by the popular web series producer writer and performer issa rae
864,from the shows first episode the sex was sweaty it was weird it was jiggly it was unflattering which is to say it was realistic really thats how sex is for you my condolences
865,i for one couldnt stand it  and it never got better
866,girls is an easy show to hatewatch there is a certain audacity in watching lena dunham appear fully naked and embrace that pearlike body and endure all the public body shaming that comes with it no matter what anyone says it takes a lot of courage to appear naked on television with a body like thatbrbrthe first season was the best with adam driver playing the most interesting character second to that was hannahs relationship with her wacky parentsbrbrunfortunately as fake as it was the girls of sex in the city were far more interesting funny and entertaining than these four brbrjemima kirke was a complete waste as a beautiful but useless addict allison williams showed the most potential until her character became more selfabsorbed and shallow than hannah leahs hannah could have been fabulous if only we believed she possessed some serious hidden talent and zozia mamet the most annoying character on television and an actresses face i will never miss if i dont ever see it againbrbri watched every episode but cant say im going to miss it
867,hated the show when it premiered could not understand the entitlement of the characters  not one is rich brilliant or successful hallmarks of the spoiled on tv   or get past the grime of their surroundings after the crystalline portrayals of single life in satc i just couldnt then at the urging of a friend i watched another episode and laughed like i havent laughed since sanford and son was in first run girls is just plain hilarious they all deserve emmys  especially zosia mamet and adam driver it may be millennial humor totem of chat anyone but its the funniest thing on tv ill miss them 
868,the only thing different and new about girls was the first season it was an almost x rated version of the cult aptow show freaks and geeksbrbrthe rest of the seasons descend further and further into empty materialism a la sex in the city and when it could be about something duhnam chose to do nothing brbrthe show didnt change television its not mash all in the family its not even at the level of undeclared which is the comedy version of freaks and geeks and its not mary tyler moorebrbras for real girl power try watching buffy the vampire slayer thats much better tv for most of the seasons and presents women and girls as real peopleeven if the show is science fictionbrbrthen theres china beachbrbrhaving to use jenji kohan and the daily show as minority casting agents doesnt help dunhams reputation for a broad world view 
869,without getting into whether it is correct or preferable in reality it is actually possible to have an inner circle of predominantly of one color or ethnicity for some people its not a conscious choice it just is why so much ink is spilled over the fact that the writers on this show or any other dont purposely try to shoehorn in characters that fit certain boxes in order to appeal to the widest demographic or to reflect a reality that a lot of people dont actually live is beyond mebrbri would agree that more representation in the arts is a good thing but not in an artificial way otherwise every cast would like like star trek which as admirable a sentiment as it may be does not reflect most peoples reality
870,dunham admitted on howard stern that she doesnt write the episodes she has a team that does it  i would encourage her supports and detractors alike to listen to the full interview from a year or so ago and how she prattles on about how she knows so much about the world from her experience attending a literal womens college ie ultra elita school for the wealthy  thats supposed to give someone perspective according to her  the arrogance is unbelievable and whats worse is she gets a total pass on it in leftlearning pressbrbrthe show also has terrible ratings and is generally unwatchable according to most critics aside from its most ardent supportsbrbrso why do i read her name and hear about the show on a weekly basis on nyt and other leftleaning periodicals  especially in the context of this show changing television  most people dont even know this show is on television and people who do dont watch  
871,wow see the headline and think wait what not only is this show still around but the nyt is still publishing fawning little pieces about itbr i went straight to comments and felt better brbragreed with a few comments that hold this show up as an example of how detached our supposed elites are from even educated upper middle class citizens i cringed when i saw the creator out there campaigning for hrc but there you go stuck in a bubble and now look whos in the wh
872,i think hottakers is supposed to be hottalkers
873,definitely not a fan of this indulgent cringeworthy show but i am tired of hearing people pile on a show for having a  gasp  mostlywhite cast i dont recall spike lee or kenya barris being harangued for not having a central character who happened to be white or middleeastern or asian orbrbrseinfeld received the same criticism to which jerry seinfeld replied youre right we didnt fix the ills of society
874,it certainly did change television it showed that you can be a star despite bragging about molesting your sister and lying about being raped by the president of her colleges republican club where there were probably no more than 10 republicans on the entire campus brbrand not only can you become a star you get to campaign with a candidate for president
875,television rarely never changes few characters rise above stereotypes and advertising images its safer that way junk remains junk for the rubes
876,im going out on a limb here about diversity  brbrwhy are we pushing it so  i dont get it  not everyone lives where diversity among friend colonies is even a possibility  i grew up in brooklyn in the 1950s and 1960s and my public school junior high and hs were largely white a smattering of blacks and like hung around with like brbrditto my life in my professional work place i was wall street for 25 years and in my new profession it too is largely white and the neighborhood i live in now is as well  am i supposed to because its politically correct go out and solicit friends with whom id likely have little in common just for the sake of itbrbri dont get it  really  
877,you want a show that was much better written had a woman struggling against much greater odds and that impacted an entire generation watch a rerun of mary tyler moore
878,i watched some of season 1 and found the four main characters so distasteful and unlikable that i never tuned in for season 2 if you want me to commit i have to enjoy being with you i did not enjoy the company of these girls
879,the casting of the four main actresses was consistent with the venerable tradition of showbiz nepotism
880,huh  never heard of the show or its castbrbrguess it didnt change much history
881,not that anyone cares but i had a lot of issues with this showmostly just found it plain annoyingbut the lack of diversity in the friend group wasnt one of them i lived in nyc for years and in the real world for many more despite what college brochures with every race represented would have us think we dont tend to intermix that much its a shame reallybut its also the reality 
882,i have watched a view episodes over the years and each time come away feeling like the characters are self absorbed the characters  people  would be better served going out to do something for other people than constantly examining their own navel to much time on self and not enough being part of other peoples lives the show did not inspire it did nothing but give air time for young people to wallow in self pity of their own little lives perhaps they should have volunteered for the peace corp instead
883,i adore girls and will mourn its absence on hbo while those other shows it inspired are interesting none of them have the profundity in my opinion of girls 
884,good lord duck dynasty got more viewers than this oddity  and why were the media critics obsessed with this and whatever misadventures ms dunham found herself in  talk about a bubble
885,still waiting for the essay titled a thousand ways deadwood changed television 
886,not that anyone has asked but at the opposite end of the spectrum of a show populated with really unlikable characters like girls is a silly and sometimes outright dumb show that i enjoy simply because the opposite is true the characters are so likable  new girl  yes fine make fun of me i know its a silly show but i like it anyway it also has the rare quality of utilizing nonwhite cast members without making every joke in their scenes revolve around the fact that they are not white allblack shows allwhite shows whatever are fine im not pc but it is refreshing when you are white married to an african american and live in a social world full of people of varying shades to be able to tune into one show that not only reflects that but also refuses to treat it as a novelty and constant point of comment it just is
887,a thoughtful piece but every time the times employs a listicle headline i die a little inside
888,as an older woman who comes from a youth in the sixties i find this show fascinating there are times when it makes me very uncomfortable however it reminds me of what it was like to be 25 in a world with changing rules 
889,great show and very much needed after the ridiculous decadence of sex and the city these were messy stories about people who struggle with finding themselves while slowly going broke in nyc i hope ms dunham continues to bring her voice to another project it sure would help a lot of people get through the trump years or year if i can dream
890,im putting it in the queue for my daughter to watch in a her early teens  seems a powerful deterrent to adolescent casual sex  
891,seems like a lot of chips on a lot of shoulders reading these comments a lot like the characters on girls hmmm
892,intelligently written well acted that is still very rare in television i take the abominable characters as an exaggeration of something real and a warning and they are entertaining like the abhorrent characters in a dostoevski novel
893,if a tv show is watched by nobody can it change television
894,girls is brilliant  i love it and i will miss it and its characters dearly  smart brutal funny and real it reminded me of my own genx youth going to school in nyc when the cool place to be was the east village not brooklyn  it  spoke to the young woman i once was perhaps a little less selfabsorbed or at least id like to remember my younger self that way  wishing lena dunham a long and provocative career  i look forward to whatever she produces next  and to ms mamet ms williams and ms kirke and the rest of the spectacular cast thank you  you are all amazing 
895,why must a show receive a scolding if all the main characters are the same racebrif this show were about 4 young latina women living in the same neighborhood nobody would be calling them out
896,objectively what were the ratings for this show a quick search indicates that as of january 2017 about 575000 people watched this show per week so it may be influential within the coastal media bubbles but im willing to bet for the vast unwashed rest of the country it made not a bit of difference about anything 
897,this unwatchable show changed television in that it was able to stay on the air for 6 years despite huge ratings drop 40 in its second year and a steady decline thereafter
898,i find the shows predictable slow motion disasters pretty funny to watch i also like the focus on how difficult it is for younger people to find a productive path in times of diminished opportunities what bothers me most about the show is the sex in the city four women friendship aspect  the men are simply not considered friendship material unless they are gay they seem like sex objects most of the time maybe thats the joke or maybe its just feminist ideology the show suffers from a similar problem with non millennial characters  reinforcing the disconnect between generations which a lot of times just comes across as immature but maybe thats just meta thats the fascinating thing with this show  its smarter than you are
899,i couldnt make it through even one episode of this show on a seven hour transcontinental flightbrbris there an appeal in watching spoiled rich people wallow in their self pity and narcissism that im missing 
900,i saw one episode shut off the idiot box and quoted loudly the following lines from philip larkins since the majority of me  brbrsince the majority of mebrrejects the majority of youbrdebating ends forthwith and webrdividebrbri confess i do this for most sounds and images that emanate from the box
901,really interesting that the majority of negative comments on here are from men i think what people need to keep in mind is that this show is really important because it allows a woman doing regular mundane things and take up space each time ms dunhams character hannah slurps spaghetti or strips on camera is an assertion that this particular woman engaged in this specific action  eating talking or having sex  is worth attention in this she is redefining both female beauty and a womans valuebrbrcall lena dunham self absorbed fat whiny whatever you want but keep in mind hannah was never going to be a voice of anything but her own confusion which was part of a joke that a great many critics seemed determined not to get she has always been too selfinvolved and insufficiently selfaware to turn her life into art that is the major difference between her and her creator i appreciate dunhams fearlessness in analzying and unapologetically portraying a character that is extremely flawed brbri also appreciate the articles ability to examine both sides the characters on girls are extremely privileged and i think especially in earlier episodes it is important to keep in mind that the erasure of different colors of skin is not really representative at all of modern day culture 
902,this show and the cosby show share an uncomfortable truth that no one wants to talk about  bill cosby chose to cast for his tv family women who were so lightskinned that one wondered what they were doing in a show about an african american family  it was so clear that his idea of feminine african american attractiveness was all tied up in being lightskinnedbrbrlena dunham while flaunting her own overweight flabby unattractive body often scantily clad and occasionally nude  cast highly attractive slender fit young women as her costars  even the supporting characters are all attractive slender and physically fit  seems that the revolutionary act of celebrating normal womens appearance stops with her own appearance
903,hbo is close to losing its relevancy and its viewers because of its insistence on repeating shows that focus on quirky annoying straight white people excluding a few notable exceptions from the past especially the shortlived looking the new hbo is whiter straighter and more annoying than ever see veep divorce curb your enthusiasm silicon valley vice principals togetherness etc etc etc 
904,i absolutely love this show it is one of the few shows that portrays very accurately the huge role that a womans looks play in our society traditionally everywoman types were played by the likes of doris day mary tyler moore marlo thomas valerie harper zooey deschanel these women are all extremely attractive not average in any way at allbrthe acknowledgement of looks affecting how people respond to you and being done with a terrific amount of humor is awesome the dialogs are so fantastic and funnybrthere was also a terrific sweetness in the relationship between adam and hannah that i really loved i did not enjoy hannahs regression in season 5 all that much in particular her stint as a teacher her complete lack of appropriate behavior as a teacher including actions that would have gotten her fired as well as her supposedly good way of relating to the kids was off for me  but adam driver is a joy to watch in each and every episode
905,ao scottbrthe barriers to entry were too high the corporate culture too entrenched the medium too square girls had an improvisatory lowrent doityourself feel that was at least as striking  and to some as disconcerting  as its frank sexuality it felt loose candid and personal in a way that few scripted series had beforebrbecause what says lowrent doityourself like being on hbo with a big name producer judd apatow behind you
906,i loved the series and wish it would keep going   in the real world even in nyc a lot of white people mainly have white friends  its a fact of life and same on most tv shows too  
907,6 ways girls changed media coverage of television might be more apt about this show created by and starring heiresses from an elite few nyc families with a consequent perspective on our city ignore affordable housing crises diversity world ignore global economic meltdown and my generation ignore the fact that most millenials wereare struggling with immense debt while entering a supremely challenging job market its pr team deserves an award but it never had significant viewership despite the countless thinkpieces written about it enough
908,the obsession and enamor of media critics like the nytimes with this show is one of the more palpable demonstrations of why so many of the type of people who read the nytimes and buy all its says were surprised by trumps victory this show gave a terrible and inaccurate impression of young liberal cosmopolitan people and i would hate to live anywhere its characters world view prevailed i confess to dipping in and out when i needed some eye chewing gum while riding a stationary bike  its portrayal of most young white women as whiners who need therapy during and drugs is akin to the shows that regularly portray black men only as drug dealers and moslems only as terrorists 
909,what is the nyt obsession with this marginal show and dense selfabsorbed writer neither one is that relevant to anyone beyond your media critics
910,whoa  i love this show  its brilliantly written and acted  tvs default world is a fantasy ivyeducated upper middle class white ny  why would girls with its most honest depiction be held to a different standard  im sorry to see it conclude
911,white girls live in  a different world  from their black sisters and brothers
912,hbo has always been a groundbreaking entertainment company with series like the wire deadwood the corner boardwalk empire oz just to name a few  they have real moxie to produce and air shows that no one else would or even came close to  granted im not the biggest fan of girls but what i applaud and admire hbo for their choice and decision to cast these four actresses in the roles they play  these gals bring realistic and legitimate elements to the storylines because of how they look  i am extremely saddened by the many comments made by viewers who found these gals physically and personally so unattractive  really  i guess because i was never a beauty my entire life i take exception to negative comments based solely on ones looks
913,the diversity issue was not nearly as irritating as the ferocious middleclass entitlement and selfabsorption of these characters  50 of new yorkers live near or at poverty level while hanna and her friends flit from one comfy spacious apt to another seek and find jobs that allow them to express themselves and prattle on endlessly about what it all means  to thembr brbr
914,most of the mens comments on here are refreshingly  oops  i mean predictably misogynistic and shortsighted  what a surprise  im a man and want women to rule this world  tired of the femalehating males of this country and globe  the ugly comments made here match the ugly men who wrote them  
915,i wanted to like girls i really did i kept watching to try to understand why the critics swooned but every exposure made me wince more and thank my lucky stars that my own two millennial daughters have nothing in common with any of the characters on girls i could even live with my daughters withering disapproval that i watched at allbrmy daughters are grounded products of a relentlessly middle class upbringingbrbrmy daughters wish lena dunham would check her privilege  the daughter of a known artist claims to be the voice of a generation she enlists her friends the daughter of a classic rock drummer the daughter of a tv anchorman fallen and resurrected in the span of this show and the daughter of a profane playwright and nudity degrading sex and jobs that never seem to be sufficient to pay brooklyn rent ensue hilarity never doesbrthe truth was revealed herebrin the final season of girls hannah lena dunham tells a magazine editor about what she considers to be one of her strengths i have a strong opinion about everything she says even topics im not informed onbrand that is what made girls utterly unwatchable
916,unmentioned here is that each of the four lead actresses come from incredibly privileged backgrounds  lena dunhams parents are famous artists zosia mamets father is david mamet jemima kirkes grandpa was a billionaire and allison williams is the daughter of brian williams tom hanks officiated at her wedding per wikipedia  i would have preferred a show about the machinations that got each of them into showbiz that could have been far more representative of modern life 
917,i watched half the first season and i thought the selfabsorption of the characters got old so i stopped watching   ms dunham is talented but im well past my navel gazing twenties and the show didnt speak to me  i did appreciate the realism of the show though and thought there was some good acting
918,male here  could we please get the same type of analysis of the big bang theory please i would love to see how those four men represent or dont represent my generation of men according to the nyt it would be great to hear about the modern millennial man finding his way in the world as well what does the bbt tell us about our problems and our future thanks
919,this show was full of unpleasant people behaving unpleasantly but not anyone you could ever empathize with or feel sympathy for which is supposed to be the link to make it watchable for the viewer  hbo probably would have stopped this show way before now except that it makes critics like ao scott babble as he does in this article  
920,i watch it and somewhat enjoy it but i think i would have been a loner in the 80s if my choice of friends were girls like these  i watch it for the trainwreck aspect same as i watch shameless though the acting is way better in that one   i also watch it for my girl crush on jemima kirke  wont be sorry to see it go but whats all the fuss about  televisions still have off switches ps broad city is brilliant i do not see how the two are even in the same playing field
921,the authors here speak as if men and yinyang do not exist taking for granted that women surpass or even superannuate the relationships in the wars of the sexes nonsense each man and woman is capable of any kind of sexual bent and all kinds relationships sex and love are stories about conflict or diplomatic avoidance sex and love rarely stray from the disjointed life is chaos thats all  its physics drop two babies one female the other male into the stream of life in exactly the same spot in a stream and whether they meet have a onenighter work as colleagues run against each other for president of a region get married or not downstream they will always be individuals selfishly trying to understand the universe
922,the critical reception of this show seems to have been a harbinger of the isolation of the cultural elite i hate myself for using this term from the rest of american life  this show was not widely watched ms dunham was mysteriously elevated to some sort of cultural avatar and the characters even if intentionally drawn were solipsistic and uninteresting  show like broad city and crazy exgirlfriend are is infinitely better more creative and a lot more enjoyable to watch ms dunham is not without talent but the rush to see her as some sort of postmodern third wave feminist auteur is absurd  
923,a great show to say the least  sure its not for everyone and most will not get it because its alittle to out front for the mainstream tv audience  brbrmaybe its because i can relate to their theatreart school angst where every twenty year old is destine to become the next biggest greatest thing in the world  only to be crushed by the reality that no one really makes it in show business or as a writer  brbrlena dunham pushes the envelope makes you cringe and very  uncomfortable that is what good tvtheatre is all about  
924,i find this show  representative of the foolish trends toward boorish and crude behavior that have helped fuel a major backlash against womens rights
925,i can name one thing the show changed it forced me to change the channel whenever it was on   its not only me this show has terrible ratings  i gave it a chance and it wasnt worth my timebrbrwhy does the nytimes and the media more generally continue to devote so much space to girls or its creator
926,i cant understood the popularity of this show  ive tried watching it a couple of times but couldnt finish a single episode  i found hannah horvath to be a vacuous shallow self absorbed spoiled little brat too clueless to realize that sponging off your parents when your in your late 20s is not a sign of urban sophistication  and her friends and lovers arent much better  if this show is the future of tv im going to be watching a lot more cat videos youtube
927,ive always enjoyed the show for that certain aspect of cant turn away from the trainwreck behavior that makes up the character arcsbrbrbut thats when the writing and acting really shine and you see the girls have that what did i just do nowagain moment of realization
928,i think i speak for most people when i say i hope lena never gets another show
929,my daughter and i would discuss and often argue about the merits of this show lena dunham is undeniably talented at writing and has an ease in front of the camera i am too far removed from this age range to know if it is realistic or notbri watched the whole series and felt that in the end it was better than many other shows over the last 5 years my criticisms are mainly how depressing the series was and the extreme selfcentered behavior i pray it was not realistic  this show was like facebook instagram and twitter wrapped into one lena dunhams frequent nudity seemed excessive and at times unnecessarily provocative when she would disrobe it broke through the 4th wall for me and the series became her personal issues and not a tv show to be enjoyed
930,i am proud to say i made it through a season and a half of this amazingly pretentious train wreck proud in the same way id be proud of any exercise in intellectual masochism
931,first let me say i am a senior man who i think is fairly objective and know i am programmed to dis the younger generationbrbri watched it a few times ironically of all the thousands of areas in the us it could be filmed it was  mainly filmed in my neighborhood of greenpoint bklynbrbrok here comes my biased reviewbrbr1the girls wore clothes or makeup or lack of makeup that went out of their way to make them look unfeminine in real life i am sure they are more attractive then thatbr2keep the clothes on  they went out of their way to show nudity kinky sex etc my motto if you dont have it dont flaunt it and kinky in your face sex produced by a woman is just as bad as it being produced by a manbr3dark dark darkvery few of their episodes were funny at least the few i sawalways made up drama etc the tv sitcom two broke girls is bawdy racy brain dead but funny and bright and cheery despite the position the two women are inbrbreditorial opinion please
932,give me an 1890s suffragist any day of the week over these relentlessly solipsistic millennial feminists the incessant insistence on not needing or wanting male validation of their looks works or temperament sends exactly the opposite message a feminist bore is still a bore
933,i have never found girls or lena dunham entertaining but i am glad they are out their doing their thing even though it didnt do it for me stopped after two episodes it is great anytime there is something unique and true to itself in the culture so much media is filtered down to appease to the masses it is great knowing that their are people out there as the coen brothers would put it playing in their corner of the sandbox and doing their own thing
934,this is perhaps the most critically overrated television series out there the characters are remarkably selfindulgent and narcissistic i suspect that reflects the world of the writers producers and directors but honestly to me it was just blah blah blah 
935,it began as a contemporary counterpoint to sex amp the citythe reality of the diminished expectations of millennials unfortunately it quickly sputtered into a bunch of unconnected plot twists and vanity projects for the actresses involved ironically the show often shows more of the stamp of durhams collaborators like judd apatow than anything new or distinctive zosia mamet was a sight gag who seemed unable to act in the first season and hasnt gotten much better after getting beyond her initial overaged virgin plot line this was a show that debuted with great promise but is now best watched as a guilty pleasure watching what new and trainwrecklike direction it has taken whereas shows like better things are both realisitic and novel girls is just selfindulgent trash about privileged young women that cant be taken seriously 
936,the first season was innovative fresh and provocative  the second season lies unwatched on my computer
937,hasnt this gone away yet  so sick of it
938,to its credit girls launched adam driver who is wonderful aside from that the series quickly fell flat for me 
939,this show turned me off tv 
940,all i know is my slightly over 60 wife of 40 years cant wait for the next season to start  thanks lena
941,no ratings powerhouse   i think the entire cumulative audience over all episodes may have just about exceeded the audience for one episode of american idol
942,i tried to watch a couple of episodes starting at the beginning of the series  i couldnt stand it because the characters were so unbelievably stupid and had such horrible judgement  it wasnt comedic  it wasnt true to life  it wasnt fantastical  it was just embarrassing  
943,there are two shows in the history of television that to me are the most poorly written grossest most vulgar disgusting and cynical and which provide nothing of quality in exchange unfortunately they are both in production today they are girls and shameless 
944,the show is groundbreaking in the sense that it portrays reality simply so brbrit is stories of real people from real people even if those people happen to be girls or young or minorities or of a different sexual orientation the stories are colored from people of color and fleshed out with explicit sight of flesh multiple points of view offer the dichotomy which makes up our society brbrperhaps it is like holding up a mirror but it is also like looking out the window on any given street subtle hues light and shade abound brbri am thankful for the genius and sincerity of the shows writers and actors 
945,a wealthy white privileged group of millennials has given more voices to a generation  maybe that sentence makes sense in the new york times
946,you are all overthinking this show  not one word about how sad it is that this in any way reflects the lives of 20something hipsters in the big city  the men use the women for whatever they want with no regard for them as actual  human beings  the women have no selfesteem  there is little hope of making a life with someone for the long term like more than three months  and it should not be a surprise that four white women who met in college are a group  stop intellectualizing this  thats how we ended up with donald trump as president
947,omg i saw a much different movie the evening of feb 3 thought the direction was wonderful and laughed my head off de niro and mann had such outstanding chemistry that my heart ached for her return when she was absent without excuse for a long stretch that turned out to be a terrific move setting up the audience for the exquisite scene with the elderly crowd in florida which in turn led to the climax of the story highly recommended as one of the ten best movies of the last 57 weeks
948,who ever wrote this review did a real great job in describing the story line  but he apparently doesnt know how to enjoy laughing at our selves and make fun of so many lifes aspects  deniro was perfect even if he doesnt expect an acadamy award 
949,sorry  but i found this a surprisingly good movie surprisingly because i didnt think that deniro could play a comic believably he can  a comic of the type he is supposed to be in the film btw the complaint that his character is more sourbitter than funny misses the point jackie burke the character deniros playing is basically a sour even bitter guy who can beand at times is fairly but not hilariously funny in just that mode eg the scene at his nieces wedding but then his character shouldnt be hilariously funny or he wouldnt be who jackie burke is  a 74 year old who made it big on a sitcom for a while many years ago and who exists in the minds of those who remember him at all only as the character he played on that showbrbrps the complaint that deniros character is patronizing toward women is absurd of course he is  given his age background and temperament how could he be otherwise if he hadnt been edgy and hostile in that cable tv confab scene his character and the movie as a whole would have had no dramatic credibility what next  captain ahab wasnt nice to whales

951,de niro has indeed been practically phoning it in for a long time the last film he was in where i was truly engaged was ronin regarding the comedian it does start with an interesting premise but taylor hackford the director behind an officer and a gentleman brbryoud really need a director with an edge  a jonathan demme david cronenberg todd solondz maybe even alan parker or god forbid martin scorcese im even wondering what a woody allen would have done with this picture this sort of film can and in this case apparently has fallen into formulaic feelgood type of entertainment a big mistake i think deniro is potentially capable of it but hes doing movies for the money apparently needing it since a divorce and he needs material and a director to push him into really uncomfortable emotional territory  
952,another watch for cable flick for mr de niro whos almost always worth watching if not paying for
953,ii am really at a loss for what plagues robert de niro in several of his films of late dirty grandpa not withstanding his performances are good but the films are bad im thinking of being flynn the intern and even hands of stone de niro shows up and does a solid job but it seems the filmmaking lets him down brbrive seen just about everything this actor has done much of it during the summer i decided to abandon my dissertation the point is in an emotional slight of hand for a few months i transferred the research skills used for my dissertation to examining this actors career  in one of the few interviews available at the time in reference to the intensity with which      de niro attacked his roles i believe he was quoted as saying something like i wont always be doing this i took this to mean that he had chosen not to continue immersing himself so seriously in role after role after role  brbrhe also said his future was in directing de niro directed two great films the good shepherd being the better and totally underrated one i wish he had continued in that direction  brbrstill as a dedicated fan i am not giving up i look forward to the scorsese project lets keep our fingers crossed
954,deniro looks like hes in his early 50s in this film did he get a face lift did he loose weight he looks amazing considering hes almost 74brbrmy first ny audition was for robert deniro for king of comedy it was dec 5th 1980 at the rolex bldg on 5th avenue i had just seen an advance screening of raging bull and was blown awaybrbri thought i was going to faint when i met him he was sitting with the casting director cis corman   couldnt really speak because my mouth was so dryi had a number of callbacks but the role went to sandra bernhardt who was perfect for the part i will never forget how kind deniro was to me down to earth and humble no artifice whatsoeverbrbri will see this film i see all of deniros work comedy is very tricky and not sure if taylor hackford is the right director for a comedy as you really need a comic eye when directing comedy its also about timingpacing and rytham born more often than not out of the angst desperation pathos and drama of the character and situation  easy for me or anyone to talk about but extremely tricky to pull offcasting in a comedy is crucial as comic acting cannot look forced  comic timing at the right moment in a scene that is when you can tell the comedy worksbrbrps i do a disturbing imitation of deniro voice and facial expressions not bad for a girl
955,dirty grandpa was as pathetic  a movie as can possibly be made i guess he made it even lower  amazing to hear the disgusting and filthy mouthed actor in dirty grandpa a vehicle made just for him criticize trump for his foul verbiage
956,review robert de niro as the comedian a hasbeen seeking a comeback this is an excellent description of de niros laterstage career someone should tell him that he cant and shouldnt attempt to do comedy or romance
957,not even streaming for free
958,deniro once got great vehicles the way a great comic gets great lines each has to deliver what another wrote  not easy when the script or line is secondrate or worsebrfor some reason deniro has been accepting scripts king kong couldnt lift and the acting shows his disappointment and resignation better an unforgettable cameo in an otherwiseforgettable movie than a starring role in a completely forgettable one but the money is way worse too many dogs and that disappears too the failed comic becomes a waiter or barkeep 
959, i thought diniro was terrific in the bradley cooper film silver linings playbook where he played coopers ocd father and bookmaker  you cant  be the raging bull every time out  give the guy a break  also leslie mann is much under appreciated as a comic actor  
960,taxi driver the deer hunter raging bull  wow  they really were the daysbrdeniro lost me as a fan with meet the fockers today if he has a major role in a film that serves as a red flag not to view that film  to borrow a phrase so sad   
961,deniro has been phoning it in for years  hes doing it for the money and i dont blame him but i will not pay for any of his movies that have become over the years basically silly junk 
962,unless he plays a violent nut he has no zing
963,it used to be that i looked forward to a deniro movie coming out now i cringe dirt grandpa  really  is he that desperate for money that he has to take on these terrible roles i think its time he called it quits
964,going against the grain here but i liked the trailer actually laughed out loud several times
965,its really sad to see how deniro has descended to a bloated non engaging actor that he once was for so many of us  i prefer to watch only his earlier movies such as king of comedy
966,watching the trailer is a great way to make a decision on whether or not to see the film     my wallet thanks you   
967,nice to see the trailer for this might be of interest for people wishing to be in the presence of old favorites in the context of something not overtly stupid
968,bobby d plus taylor hackford youd think they could make a decent moviebrbri always considered robert de niro to be an artist   he was my favorite actor   now he seems more concerned with real estate
969,i often wonder if the steady decline in the quality of mr deniros output is laziness and no interest in maintaining his talent and reputation as a great actor or just the overall lousy quality of most of the product that comes out of hollywood  id hate to think its the first the second is a given
970,i dont know from this review whether this is just a bad movie or if de niro is simply past his best buy date i sure hope its the former so many of his films have been brilliant as is he
971,despite this sour review im eager and anxious to see de niros new movie  in fact i love him  how could i not after his laudatory and accurate characterization of trump
972,why not one word on danny devito  
973,robert de niro stopped generating good will with me at least when he stopped generating good performances somewhere around the late eighties  look i dont blame him for deciding after about fifteen years of delivering more of his inner soul than arguably any other actor has for electing to take it easy on his psyche and stop digging down so deep  but there is something cynical and depressing about his latecareer film choices   
974,manohla nails it here in her review with one exception leslie mann is absolutely fantastic this is an oscar supporting actress worthy performance that will be ignored because the film is such a misfirebrmanohla goes into pc mode in condemning the actress for playing the role of an unenlightened woman in fact manns performance is so strong because shes  far less wideeyed than in movies directed by her husband and she presents a real if flawed character who grows by movies end its no mystery why she took the role why anybody else did is unfathomable
975,ms dargis review of the comedian is rightonbras impressive as mr de niros resume is frankly he has never been funny  its just not in his dna 
976,this is too formulaic to be a useful criticism
977,if this movie is intended as an examination of a standup comics declining fortune perhaps it should be released as part of a doublebill with scorseses brilliant king of comedy  deniros own declining fortune would certainly be on full view

988,the transcendence described by the author in this naive and silly essay will disappear in an instant when even strong swimmers get into trouble at a dangerous place like palihole readers beware the power of the ocean here is enormous and can kill you in fact it often does get your sublime moments just watching the pounding surf and even then be careful as people are swept away by rogue waves all the time the nyt should add a warning to this article 
989,great storymakes me want to head back there 
990,it is the exposure of our children to natures wonders every day we can that should guide every parent  snorkeling on the big island greece australia has opened my familys eyes to the underwater wonders of the oceans  surfing and fishing throughout has garnered respect for the sustenance the oceans provide  living it and showing them every day will protect nature for their generation and they will be prepared to sustain it for their children

993,1 yeah if you are whitehowli i would not recommend trying to swim with the locals unless you want to get beaten upbr2 what is funny in hawaii is that everywhere they warn about rip tides so you wont get drowned but no one mentions that if you are used to body surfing elsewhere that the waves are about 3x as powerful first day out in kawaii caught a great shore break just as i would in the continental usa but it slammed me so hard like a mack truck into the sand i suffered a torn labrumbe careful even with swimming you gotta know where you are

997,thanks for the memories  i lived at the foot of diamond head for 8 years renting the upstairs in an old hawaiian house that belonged to a beautiful lady who had been miss hawaii in 1958  it was across the street from a small beach park  my daily ritual was to roll out of bed slip into a bikini swim out to the reef and back shower and go to work  in the evenings i would repeat the process but would stash a martini on the rocks to enjoy afterwards as i watched the sunset  it was a heavenly time  how i miss the daily sensation of being embraced by those waters
998,thank you for the lovely article  after graduating from college i spent 3 months traipsing throughout kauai surfing swimming and getting in above my head  on christmas day 1999 i nearly drowned off of the na pali coast  the experience humbled me  i have a more cautious but still close relationship with the ocean ever since  what a magical place  brbryou didnt mention it but the 11 mile kalalau trail on kauai will also change your life  if you are not careful or simply unlucky it will take it as well  during my hike i was trailed by a family who was retracing the steps of their son who disappeared there never to be found presumably swept away in a flash flood
999,i had a much different and yet still meaningful experience at tunnels beach last january  during the winter months weather conditions change and turn tunnels into a maelstrom of 10 to 20 foot waves breaking all over the place in different directions and in constantly changing patterns  while my family hiked i sat on the beach and watched this event for hours  there was something happening that couldnt be explained but could only be felt  there was quite a group of us just sitting and staring  the power and magnificence of the ocean is mesmerizing

1020,gail collins funny columns alone are worth the price of a nyt subscription she gives me a good laugh every time i read her something i greatly appreciate during these anxious times many thanks to her
1021,just as in every conflict before those who supported trump or invested with him lost their shirts while trump made another billion or sobras for mr spicer he is almost as funny as the kellyann character they are both highly creative in their ability to twist an originally truthful statement that is negative about trump into a laughable lie i say laughable but it is truly sick both come out appearing to not know the truth if they tripped over it 
1022,could it be that the reason russian representatives are talking about a new cold war much worse is to distract us from trumps worship of putinbrbrafter all they have great respect for the truth using it very sparingly

1053,thanks gail if only those cursed recognize that they are cursed and use their dwindling reputations to impeach mr trump and help us be rid of the wealth of corruption that defines the current administration
1054,im  a mildmannered person but the only fitting appellation for all the people you mentioned gail and those you did not like the trump family is that they are all dyedinthewool hucksters all of them are working an angle and the peace prosperity and well being of the united states does not enter into their selfserving calculations
1055,start stocking up on champagne the day trump is removed from office there wont be enough to go around
1056,these characters may be right out of central castings pool of horror stereotypes but if there is any blame to be passed around it might first be handed to the voters who stayed home and those who voted in protest for whoever the third party candidates werebrbrmr trump has been eyeing this game for several decades and when he finally played his hand he ran the table because he knew regardless the pundits take that a man still gathered more respect albeit based on sneering gravitas than any woman seated at our political table game he is not an ignorant player brbra woman and no other person lost this election she doesnt need a name have to wear a dress or be married to a philanderer she just has to speak her mind which is more than enough to scare the pants off most men and bring gasps of fear from many women  brbrwe may not be dumb but we sure are stupid

1058,the nyt opinion pages should be a place where ideas can be floated useful perspectives provided on what is working and what isnt etc instead it has in many cases become just a pulpit for venting and a cheerleading section for the losers the losses by the way have been taking place for awhile and now democrats find that they have lost state governorships state houses the white house senate the house and soon the supreme court it seems that it would be hard to dig much deeper but of course democrats are trying this piece like so many others does nothing to help democrats instead it just reinforces the value system that brought them to this unfortunate situation brbrthe trump administration will collapse under its own weight of incompetence but if democrats have nothing different to offer they than what has brought them to the worst political situation in almost a century they will not be able to benefit from it except for some snl skits of vengeful social media tweets of course

1070,last night in cambridge senator bernie sanders addressed  a standing room only crowd of citizens mainly young welleducated and filled with energy to resist the insanity that has overtaken our country with the current regime of lying trumpery these young people are the hope for a just equitable democracy articulated by senator sanderswhere is coverage of this hopeful practical vision in the times instead we are subjected to more despair inducing trumpery and our intelligence is insulted by an op ed bemoaning the obdurate freedom caucus written by one of the radical right wing republican toadies for the koch brothers who are wrecking the country trumps lies are legion and this current incarnation of the prince of darkness is being unmasked but before he leaves office he and his sycophants will sorely damage the country satire is wonderful but writers and columnists for the times would do us all a favor if they covered the indefatigable sanders and elizabeth warren more frequently some of your readers are still feeling the bern while we worry about our country being burned

1073,he is a serial liar  eg whenever his mouth moves and an utterance spills out chances are it is a lie of the grossest kind  how did we end up with this embarrassment of a socalled man who is perhaps the worst role model for our youth  bannon and trump are as easy a read as the cat in the hat  however our commanderinchief has the pomposity to publicly admit he doesnt read  no admission is necessary  listen to him conjugate sentences if you are genius enough to make cogent sense of it in the english language  ive heard numerous times about children chastising their parents but these children blood or not are only adding fuel to the paternal fire that shows no signs of abating unless someone he will listen to makes a move with great alacrity  this is no joke  if the trump children had an iota of integrity they would either flee as fast as their designerclad legs will carry them  any adult with a medium of intelligence would distance themselves now  i hear ivanka has already booked passage on a space capsule per richard branson  so perhaps we shall all be rid of these stain on our previously virtually unstained reputation  
1074,mcconnell has been ominously silent and ryan even after his pratfall still holds immense power as the fbi closes in and the congressional grudges mount look for a hasty untergang the bottom line is that the rs are so deep in the line of presidential succession that they can scorch all the earth they want to without bannon and the trump family fronting for them in the wh they have ceded power to trump they can take it back at their convenience
1075,it is not that difficult to understand trump he does four thingsbrbr he lies in order to distract us or deceive his followers no remorse no denial he just flat out lies because he thinks it is to his advantage see wiretapping crowd estimations birtherism etcbr he alternately threatens and makes false promises to those he negotiates with see his offers to republicans during the trumpcare battle or read the art of dealbr he threatens to take his marbles and go home if he doesnt think he will win any other way of course these threats are also lies but he thinks this strategy works see his final play in the trumpcare battle or read the art of dealbr he makes money for himself and his family see the headlines today about ivanka jared and the various trump holdingsbrbrhe is never going to change this is his strategy and he thinks its smart and so do many of his followers brbrwe can all see the future for the next four years or until he is removed from office every day will have the same headlinesbrbr trump liesbr trump threatens and makes false promisesbr trump threatens to take his marbles and go homebr trump repeats his mantras im rich and your not im president and your notbrbrthats all there is and that is all we are ever going to see from this man he is after all the choice of the russian and right wing propaganda team the american gerrymandering scam and the electoral college and therefore the president of the united states
1076,im not sure paul ryan is really trumps fault ryan might not have gone down in quite such spectacularly devastating humiliation without trump but i still think he was going to fail ryan is the kid who handed in his term paper a day late and only half finished he probably should have spent less time chugging beer and entertaining machinations of health care destruction and more time writing a bill that could actually pass his loss is our gain though

1096,my question is does anyone know what these people actually do all day long i find it hard to picture people like reince priebus especially what exactly does he do after he arrives at the office pours a cup of coffee and checks his email i just have no image of it in my head i think a persons labor is valuable if they produce something valuable or useful or help others in some fashion i cannot see of what use to the world are people like priebus ryan sean spicer sebastian gorka steve miller etc as far as i can see they run around after trump trying to guess what ridiculous thing he might say next and devise wording to make a statement about it half an hour later that in some way relates to their own pet causes which are things like taking away americans health care because its only rich people like them who ought to have good health care best i can figure anyway then i guess they go to lunchbrbrmost mystifying is steve bannon what does the guy do it is worrying cant a reporter tail him or something these people are useless on a good day and apparently spend most waking hours devising villainy  fortunately so far they seem incompetent as well we need details about these peoples daily activities perhaps if americans understood they dont really do anything much of any use to anyone we could end this charade sooner

1135,as einstein said the difference between stupidity and genius is genius has its limits its sad that when spicer said things are going to be more better it didnt happen maybe the unfolding comedy that tries to pass for press conferences is meant to amuse us certainly the trumpians are giving new meaning to irony that there are still core trump supporters may make churchills saying that the best argument against democracy is to have a five minute discussion with the average voter true 
1136,most of these sleaze balls didnt have any reputation to start with the real losers who almost unanimously are keeping a very low profileare they all in witness protection programs are people like mattis tillerson kelly cohn and mnuchin the latest executive order signing photo op on trade a big fat zero in fact which ended in trump stamping out of the room with the orders unsigned was a study in embarrassment poor old wilbur was wandering around disconnectedly the us starts for the first time to take on the surface characteristics of a banana republic there is enough inertia to keep the machine running for a long time but its not a pretty sight to see us so far demeaned by this now admitted fraudster

1147,with his angelic smile dimples and all ryan comes off like an altar boy attempting to ensure his place in heaven  unfortunately for america this couldnt be further from the truth  as for all the others gail summed them up rather well  they are nothing more than parasites hell bent on pilfering from the poor and enriching the billionaire class  one can only hope their recent failures are the beginning of their political demise  if pope francis were an american i doubt very seriously that he would ever vote for any one of them whose interests are disenfranchising the poor and middle class in favor of power and greed

1154,best set of comments ever thanks for the occasional laughsob
1155,even more than being the first person thrown under the bus by the notoriously disloyal president ryan should go down in the history of our republic as having openly denounced bipartisanship thats not conservative    what a loser
1156,oh myjeanine pirro   living in yonkers ny for so many years ill never forget her as county prosecutor and turning a blind eye to such corrupt judges as hon adrienne hoffmannscancarelli  pirro should have been disbarred and ostracized decades ago  prosecution rests
1157,dont forget jefferson beauregard sessions  who forgets meeting with a russian  oops how many times and then forgetsdodges the question at his confirmation hearing    nothing like an elderly little attorney general who is supposed to have trumps back and then has to recuse himself because he said he would and now is no use to trumpbri will make a bargain with the republicans if they will stop telling lies about democrats we will stop telling the truth about them adlai stevensonbrkeep telling the truth about them gayle  it is all we have right now 
1158,all this may give a new meaning to the old term rat pack just thinking
1159,among the friends of trump thrown under the bus you left off the voters who supported him and elected him that exsteel worker in youngstown ohio who is currently working as an assistant manager at burger king with no benefits  he and his family have their health insurance subsidized under obamacare  his steel working job was lost to automation but he believed the trump lie that standing up to the chinese and to mexican illegals would get his job back  he believed that trump would reorganize health care funding to cover everyone at lower premiums lower deductibles and lower costs to the government a mathematical impossibility another lie  now he reads about a bill that would have taken away his health insurance and mr trump supports it  perhaps our steel worker is beginning to get the picture that trump does not care about him any more than he cared about some retired plumber who gave his life savings to trump university in order to become a real estate mogul
1160,the best thing about the trump presidency is watching how he is transforming all the gop leaders from heroes to zerosbrchris christie will never live down his stockholm syndrome photo brbrpaul ryan destroyed his legislative guru reputation with the handling of the mother of all gimme bills  repeal and replacing obamacarebrbrlow energy jeb is no longer the smart bush sonbrbrlying ted had a moment of characters the gop convention but then he cashed it in for what this is not a rhetorical question i really dont know  brbrlittle marco rubio  is still little brbrand poor conservative media is in a position of defending a man whose very life is in contradiction of all their values   see david frum eric erickson charlie sykes stuart stevens rick wilson s e cupp etc
1161,forget the catfish  its his accidentally subtracting a whole hour from his marathon time that sticks in my craw  people who lie about their race times can never be trusted
1162,the thing to remember about dt is that everything that he does and everything that he and others say about what he does is a constant reframing and repeating of what he does and always in 6th grade lingo  that is why the man and all about him seem to be a whirling dervish but totally devoid of content or meaning  that is why the guy seems to make sense and then in the next breath doesnt make sense  everything is always someone elses fault paranoid style  that is why spicer is a wind bag like a retweeter what he says is simply the same kind of reframing of the story du jour his responses never give more information or insight they are simply administration justifications  and when others dont accept their reality their get belittled and attacked  its why spicer is always exasperated and testy how dare you not accept our view of the worldbrbrand while reporters are trying to figure out the truth behind the answer dt s bannon the entire cabinet and the republicans in congress are taking apart and nullifying the last one hundred years of government organization and legislative progress for american voters  thats how you get to have it legal for corporations to sell their information about you  thats how russia and china get to have more credibility than the us  thats how trumps wanting it all means everyone else ends up with nothing  holding an empty bag of promises  that is his style folks  hes naked under his hair
1163,on sean spicer i hate to say i wish a lot worse  his job a little different from the usual calling of a male prostitute is to daily stir up the let us call it spicerstorm of lies before they settle

1183,what about mike mona lisa pence  he is quite an enigma  i guess hes playing see hear and speak no evil until its his turn to be the man  because youd  think a man of such great moral conviction would be driven to do something anything in the middle of this purgatory we are living in  maybe being the deciding vote is enough for himit does make him about the only one in the administration who is actually accomplishing anything
1184,where is esteemed brain surgeon dr ben carson on the list
1185,then we have carter page another trump campaign official with close ties to russia conducting a hapless interview with chris hayes of msnbc he did the same type of interview with anderson cooper with the host laughing because page was so inept with the answersbrbrnow portions of the interview with page are being used to promote chris hayes show on msnbc and the trumps still left in the white house are saying  carter page was just a minor official in the campaign brbrhis expected testimony before the senate intel committee should be must see tv
1186,thank you gail  we can spend our days laughing or crying and crying wont change anything 
1187,lying ryan never had any credibility  but now after his public promotion of death panels for 24 million and tax cuts for the wealthy repealreplace plan there is no doubt in anybodys mind whats his approval rating now about the same as his health care debacle plan
1188,i think if the recent trumpcare debacle proved anything its that trump is the useful idiot who can be persuaded to support policies he does not understand or care about if he can be persuaded its a win for the trump brand so we have interest groups like paul ryan steve bannon putin and others who toady up to trump in the hope they can persuade him to use his power to advance their causes the others  priebus christie and poor sad sean spicer  just seem to want the proximity to power even at the expense of their reputations
1189,jeanine pirro of fox looks and sounds like a character on rue pauls drag race
1190,great one gail  remember when nobody knows nothing somebody knows something fots indeed will be looking for immunity deals soon enough
1191,i can think of one person id wish spicers job on some hints trusted contributor valiant trump defender never at a loss for words funniern gail just ask hiim any guesses
1192,nunesjust figured out whats behind that drama  heres my take  dt so angry that his spying by obama story wasnt selling probably at bannons suggestion decides to seed some evidence by having underlings pass carefully selected documents to devin in the middle of the night on the whitehouse lawn  id have picked a parking garage myself but its trumpbannon so i guess i understand the choice  nunes as a loyal member of the house intelligence committee then dutifully reports the information back to the president  am i making sense so far  trump true to form as gail points out lets nunes jabber away hoping fox news will carry the obama spy story forward  nunes of course ends up as gail suggests forever to be known as the guy sneaking around in the middle of the night on the whitehouse lawn much more evocative actually than a parking garage    
1193,at your best  an excellent column both in content and tone thank you
1194,suckers all  including trump voters
1195,i love you gail
1196,trump supporters will never lose faith in their man  when trump and his friendsbrare accused its fake news  when trump goes down it will be a liberal conspiracy
1197,sean spicer  the only logical explanation is the poor gent is a masochist  which one might think would make for a perfect fit with the sadistic guy at the desk in the oval office the opposite could just as easily be true  as spice begs and pleads for yet another lash or twenty just to help him over the edge trump stands coldly and haughtily back peering down his nose and says nobrbrunlike the vast majority of trumps cabinet picks chris christie is perfectly suited and knowledgeable in the position of heading up an addiction commission  first hand knowledge and all that  that his particular poison is perfectly legal available in practically every town and at every interstate intersection and served hot in a styrofoam box from a driveup window is immaterial  it really is a disease not a moral shortcoming like pretending to not know about freeway exit shenanigansbrbrnow if trump will just pick a gun and point it at someone the nra and all those grownup toy manufacturers will find themselves stuck like a threemasted schooner caught in the doldrums
1198,when i was 14 years old growing up in california a buddy of mine from high school drove up as i was walking home in a nice convertible top down offered me a ridebrbrhe was 14 too  i was smart enough to not take that ridebrbrhe had stolen his aunts car  he got about another two miles then sideswiped another car and ended up hitting a telephone pole  he was badly hurt fortunately the people in the other car werent hurt but both cars were wreckedbrbrhe spent weeks in the hospital and a rehab facility then spent a few months in juvie hall brbreverybody on board with trump hopped in the car  joyride time when the stupid and incompetent and reckless all get together it never ends well except for one thing darwinian evolution has a big payday  gets rid of a whole herd of defectives all at once
1199,thanks gail keep it coming
1200,i typically strongly dislike articles which bring up such tiny disadvantages to women but this article i liked it mentioned with many female politicians being replaced by male lawmakers who have pushed for legislation to limit womens access to abortion which would normally tick my nonfeminist self off in a regular old article but i feel as though the beating of their drums are beating a new perspective in my heart the bahia group is going against cultural norms by becoming the first allfemale blocoafro in brazil and that problem was certainly not tiny they are drumming for their rights as women they are drumming for their rights of their race this article has influenced me to stand for any matter i want to defend with determination just as these women did in banda dida
1201,i went to cuba twice in 19989 to study afrocuban drumming  i am a woman  i didnt experience any prejudicei suppose money silences thatbut we also visited matanzas where we listened to stellar drummers in the home of a woman who was the leader of the group  unusual not unheard of
1202,i dont think this is really all that new i was in salvador brasil in august 2013  there was an all female drumming group that performed near the pelourinho that blew the crowd away with their energy and skill  perhaps it wasnt dida that i saw but it was a large organized group of women drummers
1203,i was in salvador last month and got to see dida before attending the ballet show in pelourinho they are amazing and im excited to return and go to one of their performances ive always admired female drummers
1204,why is it that men take it upon themselves to try to determine where and in what capacity women can exist  listen up men weve had enough of your controlling behavior and were not going to take it any more  times up
1205,opa
1206,not necessarily the death knell for majorettes
1207,bahia is definitely one of my favorite places on earth whats not to love about a city closing down its center on a tuesday night so that we can party with olodum all night long
1208,yes women just do it out there is much more freedom than you might expect btw i a white hetero women started playing the drums and riding large motorcycles 40 years ago without any involvement of a man
1209,drumming also makes you go deaf early but hey look at that posture and those upper arms more power to you
1210,good for them  theres no reason that batucada cant be played by women too  
1211,i love this drumming 
1212,is there a link to hear them
1213,in a few weeks the streets of brazil trinidad amp tobago and new orleans will ring with the music of carnival music that was created by african slaves  be it samba calypso or jazz that music changed the world and still has people dancing in the streetsbrbrbrazil has a very unpleasant slave past and its present isnt that great for its afrobrazilian citizens  look at the pictures of these gorgeous women and remember that giselle bunchen is the standard of beauty in brazilbrbras a descendant of slaves from trinidad amp tobago i salute my brazillian sisters and hope that they keep drumming and showing the world how amazing black women can be
1214,separate exclusionary and presumably equal is the persistent ground game among feminists making the point that women and men need not share every space of course the ground game changes whenever women are seeking access to an allmale anything such irrational logic is the stuff from which female stereotypes are formed
1215,warrior women you move me
1216,i would never trust an allfemale drum group  
1217,thanks for this wonderful profile of banda dida and the videobrbrfor the record here in nyc there are two all female batala drum groups batala nyc and fogo azul which broke off from batala nyc brbrbatala nyc plays frequently around town at different events and during demonstrations of all sorts you can see them on youtube or join
1218,the article says the band was founded in 1993
1219,giselle is actually not the standard of beauty in brazil and especially in salvador she may be a standard of beauty in the larger world but in one example in rio they actually publish the thickness of carnaval queens thighs  and the thicker the better giselle would be blown out of the water by these women
1220,better get used to the ground game changing all around you  women are over 50 of the worlds population  i suggest you try and be nice
1221,why is that exactly
1222,trust them for what
1223,check out california brazil camp which takes place in august in northern calif   workshops for different levels in drumming and other instruments as well as dance classes    
1224,if you wouldnt and you couldnt then probably you shouldntfor reasons inside yourself lol
1225,ok ok  im not an accountant but it seems to me that a debt cap that is raised continually is not really a cap nor an effective method to contain the debt  brbrits just a word 
1226,if we want to get serious about fixing the deficit well need to focus on paul krugmans seven words health care health care health care revenuebrbrhis point is that our budget problem is long term and that is overwhelmingly about the costs of healthcare growing faster than gdp and an aging country a demographic scenario worsened if we restrict younger immigrants from entering the country  raising taxes on the rich helps toobrbreurope has figured out how to do quality healthcare for 13 to 12 the price that we do  only government is going to be able to force down the rates that doctors get across the board and that ultimately means medicare for allbrbrfix that and well never have to hear budget complaints again except when one party wants to manufacture an issue like the phony debt crisis during the recovery entirely fabricated by republicans
1227,ironic that it will be up to the dems to get spending under control hope they start by reducing the military budget and raising taxes on the 1
1228,and we are left to wonder where exactly are the socalled selftitled grown ups as these irresponsible leaders of the gop apparently out on a spending spree with a credit card looks like the socalled and always falsely tagged daddy party has yet to emerge from teenaged excess brbrof course their plans include paying for all of this by slashing earned benefit programs it doesnt matter that you and i and everyone else who works has paid into social security and medicare our entire lives they intend to slash those programs putting the entire senior population at risk of dying in penury whats next to support the 1 tax cut poor houses will we restart paupers graves to take care of the people who will have no where to go and no access to health care is this what we want as a peoplebrbrpay attention all of you clamoring for that pittance in your pocket from the tax cut because you and i and your mother grandmother and brother will all be the ones paying for this reckless illconceived and poorly executed tax disaster this deficit is just one part of it brbrvote blue 2018
1229,now cmon everybody knows the deficit only matters when democrats are in chargebrbraccording to the tax policy center if republicans do spending cuts to offset the deficit increase of the tax cuts roughly the bottom 70 of taxpayers incur a net cost starting right away
1230,its called starving the beast a la norquistbra toothless government is a republican dream  no protection for the american people from unscrupulous profit seekers 
1231,soaring debt means cutting programs that assist the lower end of the economic ladder unnecessary tax cuts unnecessary massive increases in defense spending cabinet members flying around in government jets weekly golf trips for trump on the taxpayer dime etc all benefit the wealthiest among us and corporations brbrdisaster relief is a big ticket item due to climate change yet the vast expenditure is not effecting a rapid recovery fema cut off assistance to puerto rico today and climate change is no longer a concern for the federal government indeed federal agencies have been directed to not even speak about it there is no planning to deal with the increasing costs of more destructive and frequent hurricanes brbramericans are not saving instead they are relying on greater and greater debt to maintain lifestyle this along with higher government debt will inevitably drive up interest rates rising interest rates will increase the carrying cost of that debt and reduce discretionary funding even more eventually personal debt will be used up and overwhelm people that will trigger a downward spiral once againbrbrso leave it to republicans to crash the economy once again just in time for democrats to take power and have to dig the country out deja vu all over again y berra
1232,if i recall correctly the last time the budget was balanced and the us actually ran a surplus was during the clinton administration in the 1990s bill can be legitimately criticized for being the architect of his own destruction as trumps decline will be judged his own fault toobrbrbut i have watched republicans repeatedly spend to the skies with abandon even more than democrats with the side goal of creating an artificial excuse to starve entitlements unless those entitlements are for the rich while painting democrats as the irresponsible partybrbrand they succeed because they have mastered the art of better louder more hysterical pr lacking truth their base believes them as long as trump keeps up his racist xenophobic calculated distracting rants and even many who arent duped by republicans also believe that democrats are the only fiscally faulty party brbrthe only reason to spend while increasing a deficit is if the country is in a recession with unemployment rising as obama did and as economists said he should but that isnt remotely happening now theres absolutely no excuse for this level of debt brbrbut when youre spending other peoples money
1233,one only needs to look at the history of trumps businesses and his string of bankruptcies to see that this business man president is an irresponsible fraud is it no wonder that now coupled with a spineless sycophantic republican majority in congress our government is torpedoing towards insolvency we must not allow this  president to do to our nation what he has done to countless businesses we need checks and balances now more than ever there has never been a more resounding call for a responsible electorate to show up at the polls this november
1234,where are are the tea party patriots and their fancy founding fathers costumes  i thought they hated huge deficits  
1235,the republican party is a business and nothing morebrtheir goal is to enrich themselves and their friendsbronce you understand this you will understand everything that they dobrthe country is expendable
1236,the deep dark secret is republicans like to spend money just as much as democrats said representative jim costa democrat of california and a cochairman of the centrist blue dog coalition they just want to spend it on something differentbrbrbingo and mr costa could have added as so many here are pointing out that when the dems are in power deficit spending becomes a cudgel that the republicans swing when any spending is proposed just think back to the obama years a pleasant memory for me and the innumerable times we were told that almost everything he or his party proposed was going to bankrupt the nation and ruin the future of young americans 
1237,deficits only seem to matter when democrats are in charge  i came of age during the clinton administration and i remember all the focus on the deficit along with the daily deficit countdown  by the end of his presidency clinton had paid down the deficit and he left bush with an annual surplus  the first thing the gop did when they took office was too focus on passing a tax break and they squandered the work that clinton had done to get our spending under controlbrbralready the gop is making noise about how expensive medicare and social security are  this cycle of wracking up debt and then expecting democrats to fix it gets old  the idea that the gop are fiscally conservative while democrats like to spend is nonsense  brbrrepublicans want to starve government to the point where its ineffective  doing so allows them to exploit our country without any pesky restrictions that protect us by keeping corporate greed from becoming destructive  democrats spend but they do so on things like education social services infrastructure and other things that are for the greater good  brbrwe have to decide what kind of country we want to live in  do we support the party that gave us the new deal programs lbjs great society policies put a man on the moon and fixed the y2k crisis or do we want to keep electing the party who cut taxes for the wealthy gave us the never ending war on terror and drove the world economy off a cliff
1238,the sec of the treasury clearly likes to see this increase in the debt the reason being that the increase is almost equal to the tax savings that the republican tax law gave the superrich to encourage the latter to continue sending contributions right back to the republicans  with no benefit to any other americans except a relatively few who are getting onetime bonuses the real economic benefit will be to help the stock market continue climbing which has become independent of the microeconomic experiences of the average working american 
1239,i notice that since the right cant argue that deficits are decreasing well mostly they cant the goto move has become well everybody does it and anyway democrats are big spenders brbrits one thing to deal with the fog of war its quite another to work hard at deliberately creating it
1240,no worries republicans will simply blame the next democrat to occupy the white house for the debt created by trump that was the move with obama who inherited a massive recession and 13 trillion dollars a year deficit by 2016 the deficit was reduced to 439 billion a year which is a fact no republican will ever utter now the 8 trillion in debt the us accumulated during obamas eight years has been rounded up to 10 trillion by folks on the right you can be sure that the next move by republicans will be to blame grandmas 1000 a month ss check form the current sky rocking deficits loss of revenue from massive corporate tax cuts nope that will never be cited as a cause of these new deficits by the right   
1241,gop destroys economy  electorate throws them out of office  democrats finally get economy stabilized and improving  electorate gives country back to gop who then claim that they have made things better  gop destroys economy electorate throws them out of office  democrats finally get economy stabilized and improving  electorate gives country back to gop who then claim that they have made things better rinse and repeat
1242,remember the tea party movement that lifted many of these figures into congress it seemed to emphasize two themes one was that obamas deficit spending represented a grave threat and well the other one had to do with obama as well perhaps the birther in the white house remembers what the second theme was 
1243,just to level set its called the national debt not the republican debt or the democratic debt  our representative democracy says we all own it or owe it more appropriately so while i may not agreed with all the taxing and spending decisions of the past here is where we are  brbrmaybe because we have not been able to do it so far we should identify the generations whose future we keep saying we are mortgaging and if those generations dont include our own we need to take a hard look in the mirror i mean for all of the complaints about the potential deficit impact of the tax cuts under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 it is not like any of us who were against the tax cuts are going to pay our taxes based on the 2017 tax tables when the end of 2018 rolls around and tell the federal government to keep the extra  we will all gladly take anything we can get  as far as the deficit is concerned there is plenty of hypocrisy to go aroundbrbras robin williams said let those of you without sin live in glass houses  
1244,republicans are deficit hawks only when they are not in power and when the democrats have actually gotten the economy to the point of running budget surpluses they have promptly put the country back in debt in the name of returning the peoples money to the people they are the party of the insane
1245,the end game is in sight turning medicare into a voucher program privatizing social security and blockgranting medicaid so that all of them can be scaled back radically and eventually drowned in the bathtub yes  many of my siblings will be fine with this as long as roe vs wade is overturned
1246,the republicans as a policy have eschewed the very ideas of integrity responsibility and honesty they do not care about any position they ever took because their voter base is willfully amnesiac and utterly manipulable they do not care what they said they do not care what they promised 
1247,republicans favor deficits only when they shovel money at the military and the wealthy democrats at their best are willing to borrow to save the economy witness the great recession and invest in the broader public both parties are blessed with a country whose debt is highly desirable relative to other instruments and that facilitates borrowing each side disapproves of the others priorities but only one truly serves the public
1248,they are cutting programs and still running up the deficit  they are coming for social security and medicarebrbramericans pay into these programs their entire lives  these are not entitlements brbrif they are  stop taking money from my paycheckbrif they arent   stop calling them entitlements they are paid for and earned 
1249,this is the game now the democrats will be elected to restore order will have to raise taxes to cover the republican borrow and spend binge and republicans will run on the democrats raise your taxes bill maher is absolutely correct
1250,there they go again those republicans who attack their demcratic opponents as tax and spend now that the shoe is on the other foot the gop shrugs off the increasing deficit 
1251,my stomach churns thinking of the tax cut if i managed my finances this way id be homeless and hungry
1252,the bigger the deficit the better as far as the con don and his robber baron brethren are concerned  they want to keep we the people so far in debt to them that we will never dig outbrbrsorry boys and girls  your run is nearly over and we the people will demand that all the wealth you have stolen from us  and continue to steal every single day at the most rapid pace in recent history  be taxed back and throw you in prisonbrbrthis will not stand in the united states of america  not now  not ever againbrbranyone who is tired of hearing about the robber barons had better study up on the early 1900s because the con don is trying to create them   readers can start with the triangle shirt waste factory fire that killed 145 women children boys and men because the robber baron owners locked the doors to stop theft  pbs had an american experience episode on it last night to remind us what insatiable demented greed does to average people  sick then  sicker now  only we the people working together can and will stop this rerun including a global financial meltdown and ww3brbrnow is the timebrbra hrefhttpsenwikipediaorgwikitriangleshirtwaistfactoryfire titlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikitriangleshirtwaistfactoryfire targetblankhttpsenwikipediaorgwikitriangleshirtwaistfactoryfirea
1253,president obama inherited a 13 trillion annual deficit by the end of his presidency he had reduced it to a manageably small fraction of what he started withbrbrit took a republican only one year to undo 8 years of progressbrbrit is much easier to destroy than to build and since the days of richard nixon the only thing republicans have proved adept at is destroying things and leaving the mess for responsible adult democratic leaders to clean up
1254,yes the democrats spend  but they dont increase spending and cut taxes at the same time  we no longer have a spending problem we have a revenue problem
1255,every dime that were talking about for disaster relief is borrowed mr perdue said we have to go to china and borrow that money to give disaster relief to farmers in texas and people in floridabrbrhow about puerto rico
1256,brid suggest that the policies of taxandspend liberals are far more fiscally sound than those of the new spenduntilyougobroke republicans
1257,ah there it isrepublicans wringing their hands over the ballooning deficit have moved even closer to their ultimate goal of putting social security on the into the hands of wall street of course they will claim that in order to save it it must be privatized and once again the working class will be the sacrificial lambs at the altar of the plutocracy whom the republican party clearly worshipsbrbras for senator john kennedys comment about having adult discussion at some point about how were going to get control of this mess they created it seems that discussion should have been had in december before you and the rest of your morally corrupt fellow republicans ramrodded the tax scam through without any debate your actions alone created this inevitable train wreck
1258,the only saving grace to this disaster is that the next liberal president will be hamstrung in any domestic spending programs
1259,this is good news each party takes a turn hysterically predicting a debt crises that never comes this has been going on for decades  maybe people will start to understand the us government cannot run out of its own currency
1260,there was a time when the gop were the penny counters and the moral conscience of the country it appears that the two parties have decided to change their platforms and now the gop is literally going for broke
1261,whenever a republican tells you the national debt is a problem its because democrats are in power  whenever a republican tells you deficits dont matter its because republicans are in power  we are now witnessing that phenomena on steroids massive spending increases coupled with massive tax breaks for the wealthy  shame on the gop and for the voters that put them in office
1262,it wont be long before republicans are demanding that the democrats clean up their deficit mess for them history repeats itself
1263,if trumps budget is approved the us will spend 8407 billion just on the war in afghanistan in 2018 a war that many even in the military think is at a stalemate this apparently is what america first looks like  
1264,here they come for social security medicare and medicaid
1265,why should this be a problem the same thing happened under obama thank you
1266,whats the biggest threat to us national security  perhaps north korea  perhaps russia  certainly the debt is right up there  but congress and the president are wearing blinders and only looking at their own pocketbooks not the nations  this sadly is bipartisan willful ignorance
1267,if you pay a bill with your credit card you have not paid it you have postponed it and added an interest chargebrbrif you are given a tax cut using the nations credit card you have not been given a tax cut you have postponed the taxes and added an interest chargebrbrif you die before the bill comes due you win ask your kids
1268,the republicans have always called democrats the taxandspend party but what are they the notaxandspendspendspend party
1269,at the end of the day both parties love to spend the gop will always talk about spending restraint until they are in power the democrats will always be for more spending in power or not  when deficits soared under obama the democrats did not care when the tax cut was passed with the negative deficit implications the democrats found religion and the gop did not care so it goes in washington 
1270,wheres the kicking and screaming about saddling our kids and grand kids with all this debt  oh of course  the yowls only occur if democrats are in power  this is a disgrace
1271,i see just one positivesomething concrete that democrats can run on that isnt identity politics
1272,liars damned liars and deficit hawks
1273,yup  and when all you seniors who support trump and tax cuts dont be crying the blues when your medicare benefits go right down the tanks  because guess what there wont be tax money in the coffers to pay for your rehab or chemo or pacemaker replacement  try figuring that out  
1274,proposed increased military budgetingfor what what goal what aer the benchmarks of successbrmore koolaid for the flyoverregion electorate 
1275,this is not deficit spending it is deficit weaponizibg  trump is building the deficit as a weapon to destroy socalled entitlements having reduced revenue by cutting meaningful taxes solely on the rich he will claim the deficit requires cutting social security medicare and medicaid so the people end up financing via this artificial debt the abolition of their own welfare hard to take
1276,is this surprising though democrats were wrong in 1994 and theyre still wrong we need a balanced budget amendment so that when we have an argument about priorities  slashing corporate tax rates or subsidizing health insurance for the working poor  we win brbrbut now democrats fought a balanced budget amendment this is what we get massive budget deficits low tax rates high spending  and in a healthy economy dumb 
1277,as soon as dems take back the senate in january 2019 an again when they take the oval office in january 2021 oh seems so far away republicans will come back to their smaller government positions and blame democrats for spending beyond our means then when the tax cut deficit really starts to blossom republicans will go after safety net spending and will want to cut social programs but well be great again and the rich will be richer 
1278,this from the very same people who would have declared obama was dragging the us into the darkest recesses of hades when he proposed raising the debt ceiling  what a world what a world 
1279,there is no such thing as a republican deficit hawk just as there is no such thing as a patriotic republican there is only one type of republican power and power alone at any price to serve the rich and fleece the middle class and poor
1280,here we go again the gop runs up the deficit while it rants about tax cuts then when people get disgusted and put the democrats in power the gop blames the democrats for the deficit that the gop created the democrats dont dare talk about a tax structure that actually pays for the cost of running the country because too many people in the population have bought the proposition that privatizing everything will be magically some kind of solution the ultimate victory for the gop will be the day that medicare and social security are destroyed it is amazing that many people still think that theres anyone left in the gop that actually care what happens to all but the wealthiest in this country it is foolish shortterm thinking because eventually the robber barons will find themselves balancing their penthouses on a tower of cards that is bound to collapse as the weight of all the wealth sucked to the very top forces the foundation to crumble beneath them
1281,what a surprise deficit spending stimulates the economy  the republicans spent eight years during the recession and initial recovery shrinking deficits and decrying slow growth  now they claim great success when the economy grows slightly faster as they are radically increasing the deficit during a strong economy  if the democrats had any courage they would start screaming about each monthly deficit  we should be paying down our debt when the economy is strong so there is room to stimulate and spend when times are tough
1282,fiscal irresponsibility is back in vogue  
1283,this group is the most despicable gang in our countrys history saddling future generations with debt i didnt need this last giveawayand neither did the greedy corporations all hell will break loose when our credit card maxes and the bubble busts again bankruptcy is in his blood
1284,the republicans dont really care about deficits unless the  arent going to them their donors billionaires military contractors  if tax money is going to feed the hungry or keep our air cleanthe deficit must be tamed
1285,several years ago when the senate passed bipartisan immigration reform by a wide margin the cbo calculated the benefit at 15t over the first 10 years  our aging population is in dire need of more people to sustain ourselves otherwise we are going into longterm decline like other countries with the same demographics  this should be one of the strongest justifications for more immigration not less  
1286,how much longer before paul ryan the republican speaker of the house and mich mcconnell the senate republican majority leader will be attacking citizen entitlements as being excessive you may not have to hold your breath brbron the other hand you may have your breath taken away from you shortly when these two government leaders in the house and senate are joined by president trump in requesting massive increases in the defense department budget
1287,remember when republicans cared
1288,the new kleptocracy picks up speed
1289,inflation coming soon
1290,echoing other commenters here mindblowing hypocrites  the very same people who champion fiscal responsibility want to spend spend spend
1291,president trumps business model always depended on borrowing large sums of money and then hoping for the best if the best didnt happen he simply stiffed his lenders in the state of the union address he covered much trivia but failed to mention the debt or the deficit thanks for reminding us recall that when the great depression began the us had little national debt if we hit another rough patch people may no longer consider us government debt to be a safe investment 
1292,as the dollar weakens inflation picks up and a trillion dollars is no longer such a big part of gdp just observe how much the dollar has fallen and you can see whats going to happen rates are rising and will keep doing so for quite a whilebrthis is the solution that weak economies like italy and greece used in the days before the euro exposed them keep your assets in things that have some inflation hedge  companies with large nonus revenues will benefit from the weaker dollar and the new tax code 
1293,it is clear and already stated by paul ryan and other heads of the republican clan that in order to offset the tax cuts and other spending next on the agenda will come the socalled reevaluation of the spending on medicare medicaid and social security however since over 30 incumbent republicans have chosen not to run again in 2018 and the congress could be on the line since it could be political suicide  do not expect these programs to be touched until after the election occursbrbrvoters have a very important decision to make in 2018  if republicans still hold the congress  what is left of the social safety net and healthcare in america would probably be dismantled and all the euphoria about tax cuts and the few extra dollars in some pockets will have disappeared
1294,the current yield of 30 year t bills is 296 at a 20 trillion national debt our interest expense is 600 billion almost as much as is spent on medicare draw your on conclusions
1295,the united states has not won a major military conflict since wwii  we have outspent every other country on earth for decades on military conflicts our annual military budget is higher than the military budgets of the next 13 or more countries combined this number does not include the massive costs in the lives of individuals and families in the militarybrbut we are totally brainwashed to believe that this is absolutely necessary we must spend endlessly to defeat an enemy who is never really defeated the entire world conspires against usbr our healthcare infrastructure educational systems economic security and our hopes and dreams for the future are all sacrificed to the god of war 
1296,who will bail out the country once the republicans bankrupt us  when bill clinton left office there was almost a billion dollar surplus  the bushes ended that by their wars in the middle east that continue to this day  and lets not forget that the banks that illegally were doing business had to be bailed out by the government when obama came into office  
1297,so much for the gop that once stood for fiscal integrity theyre just trumps rubber stamp
1298,for 8 years obama tried to get some infrastructure and other spending to pass with the goal of helping the economy  the republicans were collectively foaming at the mouthbrbrnow the deficit doesnt matter since the tax cuts blow it up but the main beneficiaries are the rich and businesses who dont need it in this booming economybrbrnot to worry though as history shows when the democrats take over again they will be blamed and fix the huge republican hole blown into the national wallet
1299,welcome to the republican world of hypocrisy cognitive dissonance fiscal suicide fake patriotism and 01 welfare queensbrbrthese russianrepublicans are doing everything in their hijacked power to destabilize america through taxcut nihilism voter suppression gerrymandering and letting the kremlin assist in american electionsbrbrtheres nothing patriotic about raiding the united states treasury so sheldon adelson the koch brothers the walton family and the mercers can have new toys while bankrupting the countrybrbrthe republican party we destroy everything for our 01 mastersbrbrthe party of sedition strikes againbrbrthe art of moral intellectual economic and national bankruptcy gop 2018
1300,congress has a very serious spending problem and they know it our government simply does not have the political will to rein in spending necessary to get the deficit under control this will not end well because the dollar is a fiat currency which means its not backed by gold or anything of value historically every fiat currency ever developed has collapsed and failed why would the dollar be any different the time will eventually come when the government can simply no longer pay its debts and that is when the dollar will collapse 
1301,whether or not you like the way trump and the republicans chose to spend this money it would wonderful just once to hear a consideration of deficits from someone other than a son or employee of billionaire and longtime entitlement cut crusader pete peterson  you know the same billionaire who predicted all the disasters which never happened since the 1980s but somehow missed the ones that did remember the financial crisis for example  his were trillion dollar errors and yet were still listeningbrbrstrange to say there is a responsible school of economics which doesnt regard borrowing as necessary to finance the federal government doesnt get hysterical over deficits and doesnt look at federal spending the way we look at household budgets no matter how loudly ronald reagan barack obama and and the sometime deficit hawks insist on itbrbryes folks you actually can print money as long as the economy is well below capacity and create wealth and relieve misery by doing so  brbrbut this view of economics which is hardly fringe but isnt taught in journalism school is one youll never learn about it in the politics or business pages here
1302,the spookiest part of this is that the treasury is issuing shortterm bonds instead of capturing todays low interest rates for thirty years and more as it has historically done when interest rates inevitably go up so will debt service making todays 15 trillion feel like two three four times as much
1303,in their business worlds people like trump play high stakes games and gamble with other peoples money they declare bankruptcy they fend off myriad lawsuits and their investors and creditors get the shaft but they themselves escape relatively unscathed continue to live in gaudy golden towers and welcome new investors from faraway lands albeit unsavory investors who may have questionable motivesbrbrbut trump and his gang of billionaires are now playing the same highstakes game with the american peoples money and their futures their highwire act of tax cuts and proposed increases in spending unfettered by the advice of competent experts in macroeconomics should scare the bejeezusbrout of everyone regardless of political affiliation or proclivity brbrwhere are the republican deficit hawks are they so blinded by the hope of overturning roe v wade and whitening america that they readily neglect their tradition of fiscal conservatism are we really counting on the democratic leadership to rein in spending which has not traditionally been their fortbrbrunbelievable 
1304,here we have the starve the beast strategy in a nutshell  run up the deficit in order to destroy social security and medicare  it is plain and simple theft reverse robin hooding 8 of all workers accumulated efforts and handing those dollars to corporations and the mega wealthy through the tax bill bought and paid for by thembrbrstop repeating their orwellian term for social security and medicare  these are not entitlements which sound like give aways to those people  these are earned benefit programs that have been paid into by all workers over their entire working lives  brbrwhere are all the deficit scolds from 2009 and 2010 when times were bad now that the economy is supposedly booming  guess cheneys deficits dont matter statement was missing the second part when a republican sits in the white house
1305,reagan did tax  cuts and the national debt nearly tripled   pres bush jr did tax cuts and the national debt doubledbr now trump has done tax cutsanother possible doubling of the national debt from 20 trillion to 40 trillion dollarsand no one cares
1306,standard rightwing stuff deficits only matter when democrats are in charge  when republicans are in charge its smashandgrab time and leave the wreckage for the next person
1307,republicans only worry about adding debt when democrats are spending moneythen they weep about the burden on future generations and the irresponsibility of government when they want to juice the economy and cater to their big donors the spending can be rationalizedbuilding a useless 25 billion dollar wall is great but medicare and medicaid need to be cutcongress needs to stop playing with monopoly money and take budgeting seriously
1308,reagan bought prosperity at the expense of his constituents kids too and his addition of 2 trillion to the national debt would be quaint by todays standards of larceny  even adjusted for inflation
1309,br   the need to deal with the federal debt seems to have taken a back seat to other priorities including the 15 trillion tax cut increased defense and domestic spending and an expected infrastructure request from president trumpbrbrthank you nyt for writing this story but i fear the national debt now reaching 20 trillion dollars has either fallen on deaf ears or worse no one on capital hill seems to care  brbrwith all of the new spending initiatives trump introduced last night i kept asking myself  how in the world will these be paid  how could that 15 trillion tax cut ever be approved  why is this country operating with an openended check book which never balances  if i lived my life that way i would have been homeless and living on the streets 40 years ago  this administration has clearly redefined the term fiscally irresponsiblebrbri can only hope the nyt will keep the heat on and continue to write and alert its readers and this country of this looming and dark financial cloud that will not go away  this country is in serious financial peril and the only ones who seems to care are the nyt reporters  this is the kind of news that i would expect to see coming from washington
1310,the projections for the cost of the tax cut 15t over 10 years were made by republicans so you can bet they are a best case scenario  not mentioned are the creative efforts in some blue states to allow residents to keep writing off their salt taxes which republicans were counting on as revenue  brbrin the end the deficits will be higher than anticipated but that wont become important to republicans until democrats regain the white house in 2020
1311,mnuchin calls to raise the debt limitbrbrbut as the esteemed mitch mcconnell has shown our nation such things arent just simply done they are used to negotiate   or hold the country hostage if you will    brbri look forward to a sputtering mitch mcconnell in my future   
1312,butbut i thought the republicans were the deficit hawks i thought all democrats did was spend spend spend
1313,you cant cut taxes and increase spending without driving up the deficit  i think it was my 9th grade life skills class that covered the hot topic of balancing your checkbook  and trump still hasnt gotten the increase in military spending he wants nor have republicans tackled infrastructure at allbrbrthe real question is how republicans will spin it as being the democrats fault when the national debt continues to climb
1314,where are all those republican deficit hawks when you need them
1315,not really look at what is about to happen to the deficit military spending  amp the 2018 elections many americans are seething at the thought of what is happening  to american finances republicans added 2 trillion to the american deficit  plus another 30 billion in the extension of the debt ceiling  they are frozen like bambi starring into headlights till january 2019 cant wait till the impeachment proceedings begin on march 2019 wont cause us much money  expect a few laws to limit president pences ability to effect anything maybe the new speaker of the house will be 47th 
1316,yes  something the weimar republic understood so well time to print more currency  but is it thicker amp more absorbent than the competitions sanitary wipes mr trump  
1317,i understand your point but surely much of the deficit spending is funded by countries and individuals buying us treasury bonds can this go on for ever so long as america can afford to pay the yield on those bonds 
1318,thats the point theres no issue of america affording anything the us government can pay any amount in us currency at any time the only potential concern is over spending to the point where money is put into the economy and not absorbed leading to inflation which is hard to do but the national debt is really nothing other than bookkeeping 
1319,actually that was only their rhetoric reagan and bush the younger both went on huge borrowing and spending sprees  
1320,its amusing for you to say this when that was the same thing occurring when obama was president instead of seeing this debt as a national issue people look at it as if it was a party to party situation acknowledge that the democrats do the exact same thing
1321,obama inherited a 13 trillionyear deficit from the bush administration and a great recession  trump inherited a 585 billionyear deficit and a rising economybryou have it backwards  do some research
1322,umdeficits going up is not the same as deficits going down last i checked
1323,robert you might recall unless you were born less than nine years ago that deficits went up when obama came to office because of a financial meltdown where 800000 people a year were losing their jobs  this meant lower incomes less tax money coming in people claiming unemployment and healthcare benefits  we also had two wars going on that had had no provision for paying for them by the previous administration  sure obama pushed through stimulus money and aca but deficits came down dramatically during his reign  i would be pleased if trump and the rs could bring it down more  i have my doubts
1324,in my state we have a budget deficit and one of the programs they are cutting is dentures for medicaid patients  denturesso they can eat  70 of the folks on this program make less than 6k a year  so yes medicare and medicaid patients will suffer the most 
1325,hey  dont blame all seniors  im a senior and i voted for hillary  so did every other senior that i knowand i know quite a few  i think some deluded and lied to seniors in florida might have voted for trump but please dont blame all of us for this mess
1326,aimee a  maybe they think it will help with the obesity epidemic
1327,basically more defense spending pork for red state america where most defense contractors are our real need is in cyber security in special operations against terrorist groups in rapid response forces but a lot of this is going to go to large scale weapons systems like the f35 and others of its ilk that in the wars we are fighting is useless we are fighting in iraq and afghanistan using ground troops and the big threat is ieds and snipers not enemy fighters not enemy navies etc 
1328,this is absolutely correct how will we know if we won i dont see any goalpost that says victory war eternal 
1329,you dont need a balanced budget amendment to act at least somewhat responsibly  no household i know of has one and yet most of us pay our bills brbrwhile i think its a missed opportunity democrats should take up the reins of being the fiscally responsible party its odd that just a few years ago the republicans in congress wouldnt even discuss an increase in spending without an equal cut somewhere else and now they pass tax reform that primarily went to corporations and the extremely wealthyall in your own words during a healthy economy  
1330,yes  but im old enough to remember the last republican who caredike
1331,this is very true and i am not sure anyone on the left has figured out a way to effectively stand up to out of control military spending when someone mentions reigning in these costs it is somehow unpatriotic and even more money is thrown in and horribly mismanaged this should be a major fight for real progressives somehow though they remain stagnant
1332,w bushes term  remember when mccain left the campaign trail to go back to dc and vote for the bailout
1333,please desist with the voodoo economics  you can hate republican hypocrisy and spending priorities but still refrain from deficit hysteria which never made a country prosperous and never won an electionbrbrcountries with sovereign currencies dont work the way household budgets do and bringing that household psychology to national economic policy wont do the economy or the  democratic party any favors  google modern monetary theory some time for another view  
1334,deficits can be worthwhile if you are doing something usefulbrborrowing money to give rich people who have too much money more money is not going to be helpful to the country and will be destructivebrdeficits for the sake of starving the beast are horrible and seditiousbrth purpose of these deficits are meant to weaken the country to make it more vulnerable to financial predatorsbrit is a plan that is only meant to help the 1 at the expense of our country
1335,deficits arent as important if you are getting something for them but in this case we arentbrwe are borrowing nearly 2t dollars to give to people who already have more money than they can spendbrthis will not make our country prosperousbrthis is nothing more than the looting of our treasurybrthis has nothing to do with modern monetary theorybrit is as old as the world and it is called theft
1336,i hope that jane still paid when she got off its one thing to make a mistake its another to evade a fare
1337,it once happened to me also on an m34 a few years ago in a different waybri had not been able to find the kiosk before boarding my eyesight is poorbrsure enough an inspector got on at a subsequent stop and asked to see everybodys receipts i explained to him that i had gotten off the subway to change to that crosstown bus and that i had been unable to find the kioskbrbrat the next stop he asked me to step out the back door there and swipe my metrocard at that kioskbrwell at least i was not ticketed
1338,i got on a bus also to penn station after a concert at carnegie hall my metrocard was rejected the bus driver explained that the card was expired and that a subway station agent could move the credit from the expired card to a new card i asked what do i do now and he replied you ride the bus one more reason to love ny 
1339,not to worry jane fellow new yorkers have your back brbrdo not want to see your fined for an honest mistakefirsttime offense no doubt you would do the same if the situation had been reversed

1343,problem is passengers may be asked by an agent on the street to show their receipts as they exit the bus  
1344,problem   how to beat the farebeaters
1345,how does anyone get to farebeaters from this little story sorry there was no chuckle in it for you
1346,not sure what the democrats were thinking or if they were thinking at all the optics of their indiscriminate resistance at the sotu address were sending a powerful message the pelosi ds dont stand for america and americans
1347,it means that mr trump has done nothing so far to derail the slow steady recovery that began under barack obama nine years ago brbrreally  obama is responsible for the performance of the economy over the last 12 months  the dynamo that drives this economy is not the government it is the private sector 100 and it is exploding because of optimism not seen in  decades driven by tax cuts and the rollback of incentive killing regulations  maybe im wrong can someone  anyone  name three things obama did that promoted and encouraged new business formation or private sector job growth  
1348,most of what trump took credit for amounted to continuations of obama policies nothing else hes done is positive 
1349,finallybrand i hope this stream of though and editorial continues here and elsewherebrbrtrump is president thats a fact  the only real and lasting way to remove him is the votethe vote to take the white house congress the states and eventually the courts legislatures and state houses at both the federal and state levelsbrbrinvestigation impeachment and all the hand wringing in the world is just fluff and wont last and will backfire heck were still paying for forcing nixon to resignthe line from nixon  and the wounding and now revenge of his acolytes  to trump is pretty darn straightbrbramerica likes radicals but not extremistsso to candidates and voters in 2018 and beyond democratic and gop and third party alike reject this trump and followers extremismbe radicaland voteonly checks and balances can save us  ohand keep agitating for investigations and impeachment its one way to  motivate future votes
1350,president trump said we 129 times and said america more than 80 times the only word that ever came out of obamas mouth was i
1351,america is open for business
1352,one of the nicer things about trump is that as he and his adrers become louder shriller and more threatening its easier for grownups who have better things to do to recognize just how screwy they really are brbri mean look at some of these comments trumps appeal to blacks obamas helping to yank us out of economic disaster means zip because there was nowhere to go but up time for this great country to move onbrbrby the way has anybody also noticed that when trumpists go off about how much better things are its always better for wall street or bonuses for others or they heard that america is standing tall againbrbrits never hey i got a big raise or look my town just opened a new factory or you know my sister finally got that wheelchair she needed or finally my uncles coming home from syriabrbralways somebody elseusually richand somewhere else never them never their own 
1353,too funny the guys who were giving h clinton a gt90 chance of winning the election are telling us what trump doesnt get about the state of the union  some folk are just very slow learners
1354,resets when your computer has a corrupt motherboard dont work  
1355,all of trumps calls for unity and the new american moment have one thing in common theyre all lip service which is his native tonguebrhe wants these things but only if they do not include immigrants and the poorbrits the same thing ryan and mcconnell and mccarthy wantbrfor america to go back to the 1950s so they dont have to deal with anyone who isnt rich and white
1356,im not a supporter in donald trump in the slightest i dont think hes any more racist then any other rich powerful european american however i dont think hes playing 4d chess and is doing the opposite to help out the democrat cause it is troubling however how much hes being attacked despite not leading the usa into another war unlike previous republicans the economy has not sputtered out like most predicted and the stock market has not crashed yet hes being vilified for his buffoonery which isnt a crime where was the rage when obama bragged about being good at drone strikes or promising to close gitmo within a year of office or deporting more immigrants then any other previous us president or even about blowing up the debt without seriously considering what 20 trillion in debt would do to our children did he ever once consider austerity measures or allowing the bush tax cuts to expire to help pay down the debt how about using executive orders instead of legislating the point is all presidents are fallible they all are imperfect they are all putting on a show for the cameras and saying something different behind closed doors to their basedonors  they are all villains as well as heroes depending on who you ask lets ignore the noise and focus on what actually is happening today in america so we arent blind to next used car salesmen selling us a lemon and promising us the wall of our dreams

1358,resent in waiting for  trumps hordes to occupy nyt and sweep away the editors and their democracys selfdestructing latteetiquettebrbrwhat the editorial board doesnt get is that the morally obligatory and politically necessary way of trumps antagonists should be to put the search for truth and integrity above all petty sensitivities and expedient considerations  and thus save the unionbrbrits not enough for the democrats to find a coherent appealing voice it should be also a voice which seeks to unveil trumps damages to liberty equality and fraternity in america and his unique mode of unhinged realism in foreign policy without unfounded declarations that russia has declared war on the west and without another example laying a siege on mainly heterosexual male sexual desire under the worthy flag of a war against harassments  the first deplorable path may end up in a nuclear exchange not really good for the state of the union and the second doesnt sit well at all not just with porn stars but actually with the voting deplorables and moreover with any man with high enough level of testosterone and with the women who love and want them
1359,president trump should tax the unhinged panic democrats are experiencing he could pay of the national debt including the 10 trillion obama irresponsibly added by friday morning 
1360,it is medias job to point out that stock market only indicates how well top 20 of americans by wealth are doing  it has no impact what so ever on all americans  brbrit is also medias job to point out that there is no genius in stock market surge  it has happened because the corporations like when their profits increase due to reductions in regulations and reduction in tax  
1361,the state of the union the way its been done that it has been deadly dull and during the past decade has had steadily declining tvradio audiencesbror is it intended just for the elite whose media will interpret it for the rest of us and so if the average american doesnt watch or hear it what does it matter
1362,dear editorial boardbrbr  what you dont get about the state of the union is that liberals are not in charge  judging by the demeanor of democrats during the speech they might not regain power in congress in the midterms  the best line of the evening was americans are dreamers too  it looked like it took the wind right out of the dems sails  the cant have their cake and eat it too on immigration  the sooner democrats figure that out the sooner we can get things done
1363,the other day i went to put on my american legion ball cap which is adorned with a bright american flag  ruefully i chose not to wear the cap because i didnt want to run the risk of being mistaken for a trump supporter  what a sad moment especially for a proud vet  john franco is right  weve absolutely got to take back our flag
1364,the best thing trump has done this past year is wake me to the crookedness of my repub senator and representative  one of them lied to my face at a town hall meeting last year  boy oh boy did he sound sincere  i cant wait to vote them both out of office
1365,the nyt eb has as much credibility in discussing our president and his policies as it had in carrying water and shilling for hillary cliunton for the last 3years that is to say none the group thinking crusaders have been slandering president trump 247 for the last year for one reason the 2018 midterms they know very well if the gop makes any further gains they and their absurd agenda will be toast when the economy takes off as it is doing the big lie only works for a while under certain conditions readers who have become brain washed cretins under repetitive and constant propaganda assault and a cadre of manipulators willing to stop at nothing to advance a hidden agenda the reason they hate president trump so much is they have had to reveal far more of their true intentions which most americans totally reject in order to accomplish the hit jobpeople are realizing just what has been going on behind the potemkin scenes in big media and big entertainment and maybe theyre not so happy when the flag their families have bled for is disrespected maybe the midterms will send a message to the grand poobahs of times square that they havent gotten quite yet
1366,as a national party the democrats have yet to find a coherent appealing voice with which to do more than rail against mr trump and instead address the nations needsbrbrit is with backhanded gratitude that we might all thank president trump for a shot at shedding the civic apathy that has afflicted it for far too longbrbrso sayeth the editors priceless you guysbrbrnow get back to never trump
1367,sure the union is strong for the 1 everybody else not so much half the country makes 30k or less 63 could not cover a 1k emergency this is not strength it is a complete corrupt failure and the democrats are part of the problem being republicans that dont hate black and gay people is not a recipe for change 
1368,will the con don take credit when the global economy tanks  will he take credit for the greatest worldwide depression of all timebrbrsure  it will be the biggest and best global meltdown and depression of all time  good enough for his demented mind
1369,you dont need a college degree to understand that trump is an ignorant reality tv comic and is an insult to our entire nation you dont need to live in an urban blue state area to realize that trump is lying with every breath he takes and is disgracing our country before the world you do need to go to the window open it and shout i am madder than hell and i am not going to take it any more then you must do everything possible to get out the vote so we can reclaim our democracy from those who stole it
1370,the overall strategy of the current assemblage of republican overlords honed over the last 3 generations is exploitation  the republican base enthusiastically accepts this strategy with thanks and devotion because they are overwhelmed at the pace of global technological complexity  logic and critical thinking is too distressing for the base  the tools used in this exploitation are a projection of independence winnertakeall capitalism fear of god but love of country and fear of the other  evolution is damned devolution is cued  trump is a perfect human tool for these purposes  for an alternative to republicans to prevail in a gamed twoparty system a positive consensus among nonrepublicans must be realized that represents real change and a decisive move to the left  the russians are waiting in the wings
1371,the real state of the union is poor   we have some in states that wish to leave the union we have people who want to impeach a president over differences in policy or style we have senators that would shut down the government over illegal aliens and many other things  it wont improve until congress learns to serve the citizens instead of their own power
1372,the state of the union is that we have a president who wants to return the country to a previous century and thus justify the confidence of those who voted for him to take their country back support him and to whom he speaks via sophomoric tweets and ludicrous soundbites he has no claim for credit on the economy and the tax cut bill he boasts of simply transfers even more money to the wealthy while raising the countrys debt he can however take credit for insisting that climate change mitigation environmental protection and clean energy are not the future he wantsbrbrits all well and good to point out what trump hasnt accomplished and is unlikely to do but its also reasonable to note that his fundamentally dishonest angry narcissism undermines the functionality of our democracy talking about bipartisan cooperation while creating chaos and disruption as congressional republicans turn lawmaking into a secretive process is not responsible governance thats hardly the state of the union that intelligent citizens wantbrbreclectic pragmatism  a hrefhttpeclecticpragmatisttumblrcom titlehttpeclecticpragmatisttumblrcom targetblankhttpeclecticpragmatisttumblrcomabreclectic pragmatist  a hrefhttpsmediumcomeclecticpragmatism titlehttpsmediumcomeclecticpragmatism targetblankhttpsmediumcomeclecticpragmatisma
1373,t rump ran on the promotion that only he could fix all the many many problems in america  problems that coincidentally only he and his rabid base of fox watchers could seebramerican voters and parts of the american press are waking up to the impending threat of creeping fascism that the so called president and his so called congress are endorsingbri do not think it is up to the democratic party to save us  it is up to we the people to vote for them and then pressure them to deliver
1374,the small number of commenters who like trump and were impressed write things like liberals trash him because they cant get over the fact that he wonbrbrthis has nothing to do with liberals the entire world is horrified by this presidency as they should be we have lost allies near and far we have lost respect we are now seen as a nation of dunces by dozens of countries and he is hated by many conservative leaning people too never forget
1375,he treatment of puerto rico is a massive failure for a presidentbrbrwhat other leader of this nation ever ignored so many americans for months after a catastrophe
1376,i encourage the democrats to stick to their demands for open borders unlimited immigration and free food shelter clothing health care education voting rights and free money for all immigrants its a sure winner
1377,i find it so revealing that the editorial board leftists all want to point out the sexual allegations against our current president but yawned when much more damaging claims were made and proven against bill clinton  brbrnot a single positive message in this entire publication about the presidents speech nor simply a neutral one  all negative  totally expected  
1378,rail may not be the operative word but joe kennedys speech was an elegant appraisal of what could be possible for us if the democrats have him and more like him 
1379,what trump says at the state of the union or otherwise is totally meaningless to me because he has lost all credibility with me  trumps words are divorced from facts and are not even an accurate measure of what he is thinking or planning  although i have many issues with the trump presidency this is by far my biggest issue  democracy depends on some level of truthfulness when someones words have lost credibility the only thing i can trust is their actions  that is where i am with trump  i dont care what he said and i think it is a fools errand to spend much time analyzing it
1380,blue tidal wave 2018brthe patriotism of dems which was always there is blazing in hearts now
1381,your crediting barack obama for the beginnings of an economic rally is laughable he did nothing to strengthen the economy spent additional funds like a drunken sailor without accounting for it the stimulus package and had no insights on how to lift the general economy other than trying to add additional regulations through presidential edicts just stop
1382,the obstruction of justice occurred with the firing of preet bharara and the other us attorneys the money laundering investigation bharara led stopped when trump fired him  we dont know what investigations and prosecutions on trump were stopped with the firing of the other attorneys please  nyt send your reporters to find out the obstruction on those other fired us attorneys and lay out the whole comprehensive scheme of trump and charles kushner and their kids evading justice 
1383,beyond all i just want the international threatening to stop  i do not want another cold war nor even more any hot war  just stop threatening
1384,president trump has no real social policy progress from the year in which he has been in office the majority of policy being effective currently is from the former administration under obama putting false claims aside the apparentness of the economic and foreign policy we are seeing played out is quite astonishing the stock market according to cnn money has a grand total of 14 million offshore the greatest we have seen in over 15 years the only problem with his claim is that this exponential growth results from legislation signed by obama in his first term moving on to foreign policy the nuclear deal under the former administration was the presumably riskiest deal at the time that has been surpassed by the recent recognition by president trump that jerusalem is indeed the capital of israel this increases tensions in the middle east on the premise that religious conflicts have risen and being fought over since 1940s  because the religious significance to that area according to david dolan of crosswalkcom his actions have drove a preexisting wedge between jewish and islamic relations has trump helped our nation soar economically absolutely has he permanently hindered us relations in the middle east more than likely yes
1385,the only strong voice against trump the only real alternative view is the one forcefully presented by bernie sanders
1386,the gift of the trump presidency thus far is to pull back the curtains and give us a deep penetrating look at who we are as a people and a nation  to our horror we found that we were not the people we claimed to be that racism white supremacy xenophobia and misogyny are deeply woven into our culture and social norms that the voting age population was ill equipped to identify the growing threats to our republic and too distracted by selfish desires to make the necessary sacrifices to preserve and defend our union  america stands alone among the western democracies with the highest murder rate highest levels of gun  ownership and violence highest incarceration rates highest percentage of its population in prison highest levels of poverty and deepest impoverishment  america has the lowest government investments per capita in infrastructure mass transit education and is the only member of its peer group without universal national health for every citizen  now that weve seen ourselves in the mirror it remains to be seen if we do anything about it  its an even bet that our emerging tribalisms around religion skin color ethnicity and geography will play out in increasingly hateful policies designed to hurt those we no longer believe are rightful citizens  perhaps we should remember that of our peer group of nations we are the only one to have been colonized and so shaped by slavery in the south and wage slavery in the north  those scars may never go away
1387,i would like to read an editorial headlined what the mainstream media doesnt get about donald trump some selfreflection is badly needed i dont think i can keep reading alltrump allthetime news coverage analysis and opinion for three more years yes he is an intriguing personality and easy to lampoon and legitimately criticize what the media elites dont get about him is that he is a skilled entertainer and little else and does not deserve the amount of print he has gotten any more than the kardashians do  i realize he sells newspapers but the sacred duty of a free press is to inform not entertain 
1388,perhaps it was a prophetic speech potus said it is a new american moment and it was so  as soon as the words came out his mouth and we heard them the moment was over  and now he is back to the deconstruction of america
1389,thank you president trump for opening america for business thank you for representing the best of america thank you for making america great again
1390,president trump deserves all the credit for the booming economy the economy is booming precisely because he is undoing obamas mindless regulations and high taxes obama has the worst economic record of any president in history zero years of gdp growth above 3
1391,you have told us and told us and told us in editorials and in articles posted as straight reporting that you do not like president trump  neither do i  but shoving your way again through all the good news to find something negative to report does not serve the cause of public discourse
1392,trump said he would bring the immigration system into the 21st century hes actually trying to drag it back to a shameful bigoted past nyt jan 30 2018brbrwords are cheap amp for someone like trump a blunt imprecise instrument you will get closer to the truth if you judge trump by what he does not what he saysbrbrthere are rational and morally defensible reasons to restrict immigration brbrnot all restrictionists are republican in fact most if not all of democrat pols who have run the innercity plantation for generations are by definition restrictionist and all of those restrictionists are bigots their goal is to restrict immigration to the downtrodden and dependent to replace captive d voters lost through attrition and to build an overwhelming dependent majority brbrentrenched subservience bigotry amp dehumanization are insidious harriet tubman understood this i freed 1000 slaves i could have freed 1000 more if only they knew they were slaves brbrwe must deconstruct the innercity plantation not bring in new slaves ds have controlled the innercity plantation for generationschicago85yrs milwaukee108 brbrtrumps appeal to blacks will resonate an aspirational force exists in all of us innercity captive ds may be downtroddendependent but the spirit survives like all of us they dream about success security happiness for themselves amp their childrenbrbrblack americans are dreamers too president trump sotu 2018
1393,what the ny times editorial board also doesnt get about the state of the union is that we have a president and congress rapidly dismantling environmental regulations that have taken 50 years to put in place the trump legacy will be dirty water filthy air despoiled landscapes and world beyond the tipping point of stemming the tide of global warming everything else is noise by comparison
1394,i thank trump for nothing i thank instead of the millions of americans of all stripes that agree that this country is worth fighting for  at the pollsat taking a chance and running for local state and national offices denouncing trump and his team of hatemongers on podcasts in videos on social media lawn signs over cups of coffee everywhere i thank sonia pulido for the moving graphic of stars tumbling off the american flag that accompanies this editorial what trump has done is reveal the extraordinary resilience of americans from puerto rico the us virgin islands the lower 49 to alaska and hawaii i thank americans except for him his advisorfamily his enablers and the cowardly republicans
1395,trashing trump while simultaneously thanking him makes literally zero sensebrbrand by the way stop comparing trump to obama both presidents were the right fit for their time we needed a black president 8 years ago to feel better about the state of race relations hope and presently we need a greedy white man to light a fire in our bellies changebrbrobviously trump is mean but arent we past that level of analysis can we move on to the big picture
1396,what he trump  does not get about the state of the union is just  as much as how much you the author  does not get about the state of the union brbras far as immigration is concerned trump simply and irreverently called everyone out on how bad it is how it needs to be repaired and how far we have deviated from the core principles or immigration in essence exposing the raw nerve of the problem from many aspects brbrdreamers are the democrat and republican bargaining chips for everything ridicules they want in the pork barrel  i feel for them in many ways but face it  their parents dropped them here from many places and never prepared them for the consequence they now face and they are at fault i say case by case evaluate the circumstance and provide a way to stay and to become citizens and in concert make the cut off date final 
1397,the fiscal irresponsibility and isolationism underlying the thrust of mr tump sets him up to be rated by history as the worst us president a dubious honor that all felt would belong squarely to mr george w bush for his iraq war
1398,this editorial gratuitously praises obamas economy as if its benefits extend into trumps presidency some conceit obama came into office at the end of the greatest economic collapse in over a generation so there was nowhere to go but up one would then like to know what specific policies of his were responsible for sustaining it his fondness for government regulation and his hatred for business remember his admonition  to businessyou didnt build it your workers did how did that help anyone get a job certainly if his policies had worked trump would have capitalized on them but he ran on the very opposite of what obama stood for thats why he won while hillary offered just more obama the voters got it by the same token if trump was misguided in his change of policy then the economy should have stalled but instead by every measure it took off yet the nyt perpetuates the idea that obamas legacy somehow covers up for his failures a more realistic view would be that the economy bounces back sooner or later no matter who is in office trump understands this so instead of taking credit just for himself in his speech he paid tribute again and again to the true cause of our prosperity which is the resilience of the american people and their enduring optimism nancy pelosi can wear black and the nyt can continue to sulk but our great country is moving on
1399,what a parody of a sou speech  going on forever with cheap emotional stunts every couple of minutes   good to know we have great folks ordinary people doing extraordinary things immigrants and all  although he does not read he still can parrot a teleprompter and we still have decent speech writers   the dems response kennedy was not that  much better drooling the usual feel good empty words  we are responsible for this sad state of the disunion we voted or did not bother to  i remember a great history class on the roman empire which started de nobis fabula naratur their story is our story  indeed e pluribus disunium while the barbarian are at the silicon gate
1400,the snakefilled heads comment made me think of medusa  brbri hope he loses so retrograde

1404,i happen to descend for a few of them because we nasty women like to roam in pacs  isabella margaret and eleanoreyou must court our love or expect to be banished  ok isabella just married into the family but we call her one of us
1405,i dont care about the details of this troglodytes oddities thing is in much of america they are normal and not odd and they are let loose upon us by the deplorable example of trump now zoom out a little and see that he as he said and as sarah sanders said is remaking the judiciary back up a little more and see that this is possible because mcconnell and ryan and their spineless juntas are also deplorable now ask hailey devos miller and virginia foxx why ask the catholic women who helped to empower trump why i know religion and tribalism but it surely is not the religion of christ
1406,as i have grown older the more i have learned about sexism the more i want it gonebrbri think i stand with the shedevils would make an excellent tshirt
1407,a newfound freedom in the age of trump to say things that were previously beyond the palebrbrhoo wee you can say that again 
1408,many women and some men were horrified that a man who boasted of sexual assault could be elected president as a man i was horrified but 53 of white women were not and voted for him anyway thats the battle that has to be fought and the segment that sykes is tapping into
1409,after reading about sykes im tempted to feel relief that mccaskill will have no problem holding on to her senate seat but then i remember how much republicans like tarnished candidates these days the more tarnished the better it seems after all look who is president 
1410,i hate to say this about someone i love as much as i love you nicholas kristof but another reason you are writing this column is that as a white straight man you had a way better shot at the career path you have had to a top spot at the new york times than might have otherwise been the case  you are talented you are committed you are hardworkingand you are privileged  im only mentioning it because you raised the question about why you are saying this as opposed to a woman i suppose but missed the most obvious answer  you are saying it because you have enjoyed a lifelong societal privilege that has won you an incredible platform along with the serious credibility that men get when they are experts rather than being labeled hysterics or hyenas or whatever  im not saying you dont deserve to be where you are and im glad youre there  but since you are it would be useful to unpack this reality for all the men who are completely blind to it  since you raised the question  
1411,yes  yet another reason to hold mr kristof in the highest esteem  the dignity of all humans is at stake 
1412,courtland sykes might do well to heed a cautionary tale from nj where last january atlantic county freeholder john carman shared on his facebook page the following meme  will the womens protest end in time for them to cook dinner  his constituent ashley bennett took unkindly to carmans belittling roughly half the people he purported to represent so she ran for his seat which is now hers
1413,i used to joke about being a feminazi but i stopped theres something retrograde about these pejoratives even when theyre satiricalbrbrive always watched the national political abortion discourse with a mild sense of nausea because im looking at a stage full of men both liberal and conservative talking at me they all say what these young women need presuming that the whole burden of reproductive health and freedom is a purely onedimensional problem that they alone have figured out and solved while they do nothingbrbrkristoff is right equality is a societywide concern but im not a shedevil even jokingly im a proponent of freedom and equality fairness and intellectual discourse im a human being im a patriotic american exercising my rightsbrbrif sykes wants to speak in that way and if people want to be okay with that kind of reprehensible language just because they saw trump do it so it might just work well then they need to be shut down only one way by losing the election know this though we the progressive will not make a dent by satirizing this unspeakably offensive language
1414,to be on the right side of history we should all men and women alike stand on the side of the shedevilsbrbramen and awomen mr kristof  thank you
1415,while i see no value in trump i see something more going on with the westbrhere is what i see in the ad hominem attacks on anyone that disagrees with you   pure ideology that cannot stand the very existence of its opponentbrsocial media is the perfect tool for the advent of a new fascisim whether born of the right or the leftbrthink like a progressive or else  think like a conservative or elsebrthink like us or die is not far down the roadbrtoday its a social stoning tomorrow it will be elimination

1417,good job sir i agree one hundred percent the voice rising from fearful anxious men or their female collaborators cannot put the genie back in the bottle  women have found their free voice  now let us see what we can do to make htis country and this world  more equitable charitable and healthy
1418,some more encouraging news from flyover country aka missouri we arent all dinosaurs like sykes and his predecessor todd akin   last weekend i was one of the speakers at a allday training event for progressive women candidates for elected office  over 80 women from across the state were in attendance  up from about 18 at a comparable event 2 years ago  id call that progress
1419,men are such delicate and fragile creatures always needing reassurance of our strength and virility and place in the worldbrand i am sick and tired of itbri realize that my wife and i do not see many things in exactly the same way sometimes i celebrate those differences and sometimes i am just completely baffled  i can live with thatbri may believe that my ways are best but i hope i am wise enough to leave room for doubts about thatbri hope i also am wise enough to leave room for the idea that maybe her ways are really better  lets wait for results so we can seebrmen have had the reins of civilization economy and politics for most of the history of humankind  we have brought the existence of humankind right to the brink with planet degradation and nuclear winter possibilities  i think it far past time to let our hands be guided by the mother as well as the father

1421,nicholas kristof writes why is a man writing this column frankly because womens rights arent just a womans issue any more than civil rights were just a black issue we all have an interest in a more fair society  and if only women speak up for gender equity they may be dismissed as shrill hyenasbrbrhowever there many differences between the civil rights and the womens rights struggles and one major one is this while the fight for the rights of africanamericans was being waged there was no question that they were not faring as well as whites in nearly every area and this certainly included black children vs white children and such is still the case but it is not the case for women today especially where boys and girls  who are men and women to be  are concerned as kristof himself noted in a 2010 times piece the boys have fallen behind in the united states and other western countries alike it is mostly boys who are faltering in school the latest surveys show that american girls on average have roughly achieved parity with boys in math meanwhile girls are well ahead of boys in verbal skills and they just seem to try harder brbramong other data he noted that young men comprised only 43 of college undergraduatesbrbrsadly things have not improved for boys or young men its no backlash to be concerned about this kind of disparity one which has gone on unabated for well over 20 years
1422,well its quite clear claire mccaskill will have no problem dispatching this anachronistic buffoon  id also hint to the fiancee she could do a lot better an not much worse at present hint wake upbrtrouble is mr kristof when the tables are turned it doesnt look different  i spent my last 7 working years under a program manager who hired her friends even though they were minimally qualified and not recommended by committees of her own appointing  the sword of discrimination cuts both ways and it was painful to see older much more qualified candidates bypassed so she could select her running partner in one case  two wrongs will never make it right  
1423,thank you mr kristoff  you are right womens rights arent just a womans issues any more than civil rights were just a black issue we should all be equal in the eyes of the law and no gender or color or creed should be demonizedbrbrsykes is either drinking the koolaid or simply looking for his 15 minutes of fame by being outrageous like his role model in the wh or even scarier he actually believes the claptrap he is selling another gop anachronism who wants to come home to the plantation he is about 150 years too latebrbrtrump is a role model for children not having any
1424,if i were sykes id sign up for some cooking classes
1425,blessings on you from an fellow oregonian  we admire your continued stands for womens issues clearly we need more men to be involved and supportive of family planning issues as well as our other rights and thanks for pointing that outbrbrand having just also read gail collins today regarding these issues it always puzzles me how issues like birth control and family planning can even considered just the concern of womenthere is always male involvement at some stage in the process and also the outcome so why wouldnt they care as much as the women involved and if nothing else it often becomes a pocketbook issue for them down the road  and  that seems to always be their number one issue on which they base all their decisions  will it cost me more money
1426,a perfect column nick thank youbrvery muchbrwhen hillary clinton lost the electoral college to a washedupbrcelebrity i despaired but thebrwomens march broughtbrme back to hopefulness and ivebrbeen working ever since to electbrmore women to public officebrthis years march in oakland hadbrso many men marching with usbrit seemed that a tidal wave ofbrlove and support washed over allbrof us i really dont believe that many men support mr cortlandsbrextreme worldviewbrby the way years ago in an illinoisbrgubernatorial election i voted forbrthe moderate gop womanjudybrbaar topinka over the democratbrrod blagoyavich she was eminently qualified because shebrhad been the state comptroller forbr20 years and we needed a governor who could straighten outbrthe states finances the gop boysbrdidnt give her much support andbrthe media made fun of her hairbrshe lost illinois lost and rodbrblagoyavich is still serving time inbra federal prisonbrwomen and men of good will whobryearn to serve our republicstepbrright upyouve got a big crowdbrbehind you
1427,the good news is  it is much easier to fight against the tyranny of those you can identify ive been shocked by comments of male friends but women have made such huge progress and corporation boards only want to hire women while 3 out of 4 open seats go to men why is getting to 5050 so threatening as kristof points out we will all be better off if womens equal contributions were equally valued  it is not a zerosum game if i win you lose it is the reality of rising tide lifting all boats brbrim glad we women and some men have gotten angry perhaps angry enough not to take inequity any longer the huge progress some claim that women have made there is a high water mark at 20 in spite of women being better educated than men  for 30 years more ba and master degrees since 1987 womens participation in our economy has been stuck at 20 or less congress 20 fortune 500 board directors 20 professional chefs 19 corporate csuite 18 nominated for last six grammy ceremonies 93 ceos 6 in addition to getting paid 20 less for the same work on average and much much less in maledominated professionsbrbrmore than time to make the dictionarys definition of feminism a reality that women have political social and economic equality with men i wish that people would stop messing with the definition it is not a campaign against men it is a campaign for equal opportunity 
1428,hurray for nasty womenand she devils  the more the betterbrbrheres hoping that poor unfortunate woman who is apparently slated to marry sykes learns to be a very nasty woman too
1429,this is clearly a cock in the sense of a chicken and wants a hen  there are lots of people who think like him  and lots of hens out there to accomodate him  the voters will decide if they want a rooster or a brooding hen
1430,just another embarassment for missouri  you would have thought that todd akin would have been lesson enough
1431,sykess statements are so absurd and so far out of the public mainstream to suggest that he may be a liberal plant designed to sully the entire conservative man population  but when put in the context of the public lives of a trump a ryan a mcconnell  it may only be that he simply that stupid  another man child  must be an evangelical
1432,yes we all know of the familyoriented never straying habits of your liberal heroes in the press academia and hollywood  like the ones who got famous making sex tapes  like every kennedy male and their successor from hope  like nyt reporters whose reported treatment of women is covered up by hypocrite cronies  perhaps even by the likes of you  like these wonderful stroytellers allen amp polanski or the scions of slave holders like affleck and al gore  all these paragons of liberal ethics  so blind they have no idea how motivated we are to bury them election after election  
1433,if the choice is either shedevil or servile breeding stock i wouldnt hesitate for even one second to choose to be a shedevilbrbrits both sad and angering that some men are so perversely stuck in their demands for virtual sex slaves who serve dinner
1434,a new quinnipiac poll finds that 72 percent of republicans consider trump a good role model for childrenbrbrthis should be no surprise as the gop is all about white male domence and making money at any and all costs doesnt that point to our dear leader trump 
1435,nickbrbri understand you have a coloum to write but why give the guy the free publicity  havent you learned your lesson w trump
1436,i live with shedevils courtland sykes clearly doesnt know what hes missing
1437,i was going to comment on this but could not spell the sound hat emerged when i read it
1438,i can barely think because the snakes in my head keep writhing  but here goes  women are done  we are over the crazy misogynist meanderings of courtland sykes and his ilk  we are over being told to get back in the kitchen  you mr sykes my poor deluded fool best learn to operate the microwave so you dont starve in the future  and get some meal delivery service numbers in your cellphone if you are okay using such advanced technology  because i guarantee that your imaginary future daughters are going to serve you a dish best served cold
1439,and how many white women will vote for this neanderthal brbrthe majority of white women voted for trump roy moore and for ed gillespiebrbrdear white womenbrbrfree your mind and the rest will followbrbrpeacebrthe resistance
1440,i dont know what deal was made with melania so that she would show up at the state of the union but i have a feeling that we will not be seeing a lot of her in future months  melania is not stupid and that white pantsuit sent an intentional message i think shes done with donald brbri hope that melania and her son dump the jerk and move forward with their lives  her marriage was always transactional but public humiliation was not part of her deal 
1441,men like sykes are scared very scared and they should be  brbrcompetent women and people of color everywhere are using modern laserguided missiles to pulverize the millenia of detrius put in their path by mediocre white guys brbrequality is coming theres no going back 
1442,cant wait for our current president to award the presidential medal of freedom to phyllis schlafly ayn rand and ruth bell graham  sarah palin  jeanne kirkpatrick  
1443, right up there with she was warned but she persisted  may shedevils always persist
1444,slithering around here on the left coast sidling along the seashore then crawling across the waterlogged fields it is hard to fathom or comprehend or understand the thinking patterns of some who are so woefully out of date does this man know he can order his dinner delivered on time every night right to his doorstep or he can preorder a weeks worth of food store it in the freezer and choose something new each night to think it is the duty of a wife to stay at home in the kitchen preparing the food setting the table finding his slippers when she could be out and about having fun perhapsbrpursuing he own careerwell it is all too much will slither over to mybrunderground cave blow out the candle and ponder what is to become of all this cheers
1445,why is a man writing this column hm what sprang to my mind was not your feminism but the preponderance of men among the nyt opinion writers 
1446,of course sykes is abhorrent  no one with any sense would support him  but look who missouri has as governor nowadays  greitens has an affair threatens the woman to keep her quiet at least trump paid her off and he and his staff use text applications that delete the messages leaving no trace of what transpiredbron the other hand mccaskill jumped on franken and didnt even allow the necessary investigation of accusations made by partisan womenbrbrdont know if there is anyone i can vote for anymore  kind of like 2016 ill go to the polls this fall with a clothespin on my nose
1447,sykes photo is hilariousthe hair the scowl the beefy running to chubby shoulders he looks like the guy that tried to sell me a timeshare hes one of the guys that makes politics fun i love these jokers from nowhere who come on the scene cause a commotion with their outrageous and ridiculous ideas and then disappear and then usually reemerge a few years later after an arrest for something embarrassing what is it about politics that attracts these characters
1448,ill take a shedevil any day  why are some men so scared of strong womenbri guess they figure they cant compete without their traditional advantages  sad
1449,mr sykes for the first time in my life i wish i lived in missouri so i could vote for ms mccaskill
1450,its interesting that mr sykes who expects his future daughters to become traditional homemakers and family wives hasnt quite gotten around to marrying the woman who dutifully fixes his dinner and shares his bed
1451,really  way to grab a straw man and make him the issue  the thing is metoo is real  but it isnt about lunatics like this guy who spout mad men theology on the corner  it is about the clintons kennedys trumps of the world who treat young women like desk accessories  make it real  out them all  
1452,bhagawad geeta the holy book of hindu says yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra devatabrthe meaning is something like wherever women are given their due respect even the deities like to reside therebrin this sense you are absolutely right but the winds are blowing somewhat in opposite directions these days one after another cases of women sexual abuse harassment cases are coming forward and it seems like if you could  bypass them you will be a herobrthese books that supports women empowerment were written in prehistoric times in india but the subsequent rulers raja maharaj mugal all used women as tools for amusement only  and the consequences are in front of the whole worldbrwherever women are suppressed look at those countries where are they  
1453,the fundamental fault line today is between those working toward broader opportunity and those yearning for a mythic past before feminists developed nasty snakefilled headsbrbryou are just adding to the polarisation and acting just like the extreme you denounce by using this extreme politician who even you admit has little chance of getting elected as representative of the other sidebrbrthere are crazies at both end of the spectrum making the debate one between the extremes drowns out the moderate middle and is leading the us to civil war
1454,i also would like a hot meal on the table when i come home from work who wouldnt
1455,men the world over have had centuries of war and strife when you provide aid to the poor there is a better chance that the aid will benefit the children if the aid is given to the mother many marriages suffer because men have been raised to feel superior and belittle women we have a marvelous planet and this is the house that women can work to put in order everyone can have a seat at the table
1456,policies are important and so are facts unfortunately men like coutland sykes never let facts get in the way of their conclusions brbrwhile this isnt exclusively a republican trait it has taken on a special life in the hands of the current occupant of the white housebrbrwhile sykes may not want his daughters to grow up to be career obsessed if he looks around his great state hed discover that without career obsessed women the economy of missouri and most other states would collapse without women in the paid workforcebrbrwhen household wages are measured they show that for the last thirty years no only have wages for most americans have been flat they would have been in negative territory but for the working wifebrbrby working wife i mean women who in addition to doing most of the housework and child care also work a paid job outside of the homebrbrcollege graduates are now past the 50 female mark and college enrollment is approaching 60 women are properly seeking careers and in doing so have become indispensable elements in our national economy in fact the only thing that has kept the middle class from economic collapse has been the working wifebrbrso candidate sykes not only wants to turn the clock back on womens rights he wants to ignore economic reality  
1457,excellent column but i have to say that i love the snake filled heads bit id like for every man i encounter to think i have a head full of snakes that i could unleash on them if i am disrespected
1458,bravo and thank you mr kristof 
1459,i stand with the shedevils too the sisters day is coming 
1460,twentyfive comments and almost all nauseating in their sanctimony at this rate trump will be reelected i despair
1461,eeee gads as the actor william powell exclaims in the wonderful film life with father  his wife played by irene dunne has charged a figurine and explains that it really does not cost him anythingsuch fun  i think this young man needs to stop listening to other misogenistic people and enjoy this film   he probably wont have time to read autobiographies of hillary clintons life stages or those of eleanor roosevelt and so on
1462,backlashes go way back yep read mary beards women in power which notes that this sort of language goes all the way back to the greeks women were to be silenced and if they were not they were termed medusas snakefilled heads and banshees screaming its utterly disheartening that for some men this is still the attitude
1463,this is great but im sure the shedevils would say you dont go far enough and are too easy on the patriarchy 
1464,the fundamental fault line today is between those who see bonny tylers i need a hero as an ode to soontobeextinct unabashedsexuality and those whore yearning for an asexual future the rest is just mr kristof taking easy shots at a missouri deplorable atavist while basically ignoring the equally deplorable new yorks male organ is a weapon of mass female destruction shamingmobbrbrdevil woman used to be a nickname for a witching temptress  the scourge of the routine sanctity of the weddingbed the helens of troy before the abducted interpretation of homers classic  theyll be soon gone along with their testosteroneaddicted captive males and with them the future of the sultry sexscenes in american movies   hoping to escape the screening of the editors committee on prosex activities this time around i seal it with a kiss and the doomed linesbri need a herobrim holding out for a hero til the end of the nightbrhes gotta be strongbrand hes gotta be fastbrand hes gotta be fresh from the fight
1465,how does sykes fiancee manage to slap a homecooked meal on the table for old heman courtie when they live in separate states we await his answer
1466,some poeple in missouri think this sykes character is running just to make josh hawley look normal  
1467,this is once again a class conflict masquerading as moral issue  as perpetrated by both sykes and kristofbrbrhow about standing with the shedevils who want societywide income distribution a 15 minimum wage medicareforall and free college tuition and arent interested in endlessly placating the rightwing fringe because it makes good oped kumbaya copy
1468,sykes and his foolishness would be funny if it werent so patheticbrbrdo the republicans and their supporters who spew and  buy into this nonsense understand exactly how howlingly ridiculous they make themselvesbrbrmr kristof is right they are on the wrong side of history not only are women increasingly able to define themselves without benefit of their judgments more and more men like mr kristof are not only unthreatened by that they support itbrbrrepublicans stop this foolishness and join the 21st century
1469,if sykes were a real man he would have been on horseback shirtless in his campaign photo  a trump endorsement would be immediately forthcoming
1470,what a fabulous gift mr sykes is to claire mccaskill 
1471,the survival of our species is absolutely dependent on greater involvement in decisionmaking on all levels of our society by women  it cant happen soon enough as our maledominated approach has already brought us to the edge of selfdestruction
1472,actually what we really need are both women and men who possess integrity its in such short supply here because most people regardless of gender worship power and money
1473,wait  what was that mr sykes saidbrbrsomeone ought to inform old mr sykes that if he wants a cook or a house custodian that it is cheaper and more efficacious to hire one than to try to marry to get onebrbrhe has a fiance  i suspect that unless he is holding a shotgun against her she aint going down the aisle with that man  or she would be wise not to
1474,it will be sweet sweet irony when all those pink hats flood the polls on nov 6 and start the process that will ultimately result in trump being chased out of the white house 
1475,im still not certain that sykes isnt some kind of parody candidate that bob forehead shot from his website doesnt help are we sure this isnt from an indie movies marketingbrthat or poes law finally extends to election rhetoric
1476,this is just another random dude whos not even going to be elected he doesnt deserve this kind of publicity
1477,the wreckage of hilary clintons personal life shes still married to her first husband has an accomplished daughter and a sweet grandchild doesnt look like wreckage to me brbrsure shes had to weather some storms but her husbands infidelities are not a reflection on her feminism
1478,wonderful reflection of the infamous cathy newman interview of jordan petersen where she continually rephrased his statements applying some sort of altright meaning to them brbrshe repeatedly said so youre saying followed by some neomarxist restatement of his words which were consistently misrepresentations of his rather exactly stated positionsbrbrkristof takes sykes statements which apparently said nothing at all about trump and rephrased it   so youre saying that trump is your example of a feminist followed by lots of neomarxist tripe about an oppressed category of humanitybrbrbeautiful
1479,there are two ingroups in the us each trying to demonize the other  that is reason that congress has become dysfunctionalbrbrliberals like nicholas kristof have forgotten the poor and now try to demonize men  they forget that many of the poor are men as well as women many that have no jobs are men many who die early of cancer because they have no health care which covers cancer screenings are menbrbrkristof seems to admit that weinstein is different that franken  but why then did al franken lose his senate seat without due process  have liberals forgotten that they once fought for innocence until proven guilty due process instead of lynching by the mediabrbrmen have no choice now but to vote for republicans and trumpbrbrotherwise they are at risk of losing their job on the accusation of a woman  bump into a woman in an elevator or disagree with a woman at work and she can accuse you of sexual harassmentbrbrthere is no trial no investigation just public shaming in the mediabrbrwhere is the recognition that men are also just people fallible like women making mistakes like women but worthy of a trial when they are accused not summary judgment ending their careersbrbrdont liberals realize that the metoo movement will cause men to vote for trump in droves for the simple purpose of selfpreservationbrbryes trump uses coarse language  but he represents people who are poor whose lives are coarse who die early of povertybrbrliberals like kristof have abandoned them
1480,sykes is not even married and he expects dinner cooked at 6does his fiancee have a job or is  she his mistress could she love and live with a woman hater what kind of woman would vote for him or even trumpbrhillary has been the worlds most admired woman for a decade trump is probably the most hated manbri read somewhere melania had a prenup stating that the donald could have affairs only with women older than herbrwomens lives matter and name calling is harassment
1481,i am a radical feminist because i like all women am a human being and a citizen as for what to make about all the many aziz ansaris of the world whom every woman has had to endurewe are determined that the price of male pleasure is not female physical and emotional pain and trauma 
1482,i stand with the shedevils too  over and over through court cases and media stories women receive the message there is no protection for you and no justice  brbrif you are alone in a room with a man he can effectively do anything he wants because whos to say you didnt consent  if you take a taxi home because youve had too much to drink and the cab driver sexually assaults you as happened in halifax too bad because whos to say you didnt consent  brbrour criminal justice system seems great at going after the man jumping out of the bushes kind of attack  unfortunately most women already know their attackerbrbrin the west we may snicker at islamic law which says there must be 4 adult male witnesses to a rape to result in a conviction  but in practice is it that much different herebrbrand as for harassment if it takes place in an institutional setting and the harasser is a powerful or valued executive those employed by the institution are extremely motivated to protect the institution and by extension the valued executive  similarly if the harassed woman works in a restaurant or hotel and is harassed by a customer her employers have every motivation to not alienate the customer brbrno protection no justice
1483,sykes is clearly mad as a hatter and despite his colorful language no master of english manophobic i believe if that were a word it would mean something like suffering from an irrational fear of hands or possibly of magicbrbreither way his comments however offensive and ignorant should be relegated to the dustbin of herstory my word mr sykes 
1484,spent some time watching the news this morning with my wife whos generally pretty progressive i am most certainly not when yet another metoo story came on  i knew the backlash was coming when she turned to me and said this is getting wayyyyy out of hand  theres no nuance or subtlety to it and its going to hurt women in the long run  brbrif i couldve dropped the mic id have done so  brbrkeep feeding the anger folks  see where it gets you in the long run
1485,i stand with the women while i get the idea of triumphantly appropriating the sexbaiters term shedevils id rather notbrbramerica needs far more of womens influence in public office and in other positions of leadership and all through society because  on the whole  women operate at a higher level of maturity than the boys club that has been dominant up to now bombast and bellicosity are for the boysbrbrliving to see women break into the existing club and proceed to outdo its male members in retrograde behavior and speech would be depressing id rather go for broke and hope that i live to see society imbued with womens maturity sanity and peoplebased sense of valuesbrbra hrefhttpthefamilypropertyblogspotjp201801thevoyagetorestorationhtml titlehttpthefamilypropertyblogspotjp201801thevoyagetorestorationhtml targetblankhttpthefamilypropertyblogspotjp201801thevoyagetorestorationhtmla
1486,sounds like sykes has a bad case of what i once heard a good man call testosterone poisoning
1487,if mr sykes wants to come home to dinner on the table by 6pm then he should pay someone to do that he seems to have confused the concept of a partner in a relationship with unpaid hired help if he has found someone who wants to take on that role for him thats fine for him but he must not expect all women to live according to his plan since he has not figured it out yet women are people just like men they want to do what they want to do the problem seems to be less about manophobic shedevils and more about hysterophobe dinosaurs like sykes the shedevils of missouri will put this bumbling dinosaur out to pasture
1488,somebody needs to turn this she devil thing into a memebrbrits got to be one of the funniest two word combinations in the english language
1489,the sad reality may be that as much as racism is alive in america sexism may be even livelier what does it say that it was easier to elect a black man as presidentrunning against an experienced legislator and war herothan a white womana white woman running against an incompetent amateur and draft dodger  sad  
1490,sorry mr sykes but if your manhood is dependent upon being fed promptly at a particular time of day by a particular person with no agency of your own it sounds like youre the one who looks down on men not the feminists who haunt your nightmares by asking to be treated like people the horror the horror children and pets can adapt to irregular feeding times and take basic steps to get that food into their faces so surely a big strong man can make his own sandwich
1491,its hard to analyze the insane ramblings of this guy what kind of an upbringing did he have where he thinks its ok to treat women like his personal slaves  at least wife 3 of the serial adulterer gets the trappings of wealth 
1492,many years ago i had a boss tell me  when i complained about being passed over for a promotion for the third time that i should be married and home taking care of my kids now mind you i was single and supporting myself so his comment blew me away there were no laws then that i could have used to sue and in the end im grateful that i didnt leave he was fired shortly after  turned out he wasnt doing such a good job after all  i got a new boss who turned out to be a great mentor for me and i ended up with my old bosss job  when i think back on those supposed good old days i shudder to think that there are still men around like courtland sykes who proudly call women who stand up for themselves shedevils and think they can run for the us senate and win of course isnt the governor of missouri being accused of blackmailing his mistress  and isnt it also the place where the last guy who ran as a republican was the one who claimed that women who were raped couldnt get pregnant  must be something in the water in missouri
1493,why stop at more women on boardsbrbrhave you done the math on the split between the number of male and female oped columnists at the new york timesbrbrperhaps that would be be a good place to start with the empowerment of women since it is after all the most important trend in the world and everything
1494,mr sykes 1850 called they want you back
1495,these crazy diatribes tribes are the product of the republican bases celebration of misogyny and antipolitical correctness really just a thinly disguised way to endorse cultural meanness normal civility keeps getting further and further away in the rear view mirror
1496,ive always liked snakes i also think being a shedevil is a lot better than being a doormat so heres to snakes and shedevils
1497,what is it with missouri and crackpot republican candidates for senate seats  last time around we got todd akin and his victims of legitimate rape rarely get pregnant assertionbrbrdo people really believe this stuff
1498,i want a tee shirt that says im with shedevil  it should be red
1499,personally i stand with the shedevilsbrbrthey create really good and funny protest march signsbrbrremember a shedevils place is in the housebrand in the senate
1500,we welcome you nick your wife is a very intelligent and lucky woman
1501,kristof writes eloquently about the empowerment of women and firmly believes in in yet does not think prostitution and the sex industry should be legalized kind of a contradiction there no
1502, tendency to defer to male selfconfidence rather than female expertise  this resonates strongly with me as a female physician   i  encourage all of us to push the limits of our comfort zones and speak up for young women entering maledominated professions  i sometimes find myself advising talented middle school girls  never work for anyone dumber than yourself
1503,six years ago conservative democrat claire mccaskill was rescued when her rightwing opponent jabbered about legitimate rape maybe the gop will rescue her yet again by nominating this guy with his wacky ideas about feminism and women missouri has mark twain in its favor but apart from that i just dont know what to say about that state 
1504,trump a role model for children lets start a list of traits lying ends justify the means predation attack all attackers regardless of merit accept credit but never blamewhat kind of parents are these
1505,   excellent arguments in defense of women the better half of humanity by far why do you think otherwise that some of us men behave so stupidly repressed sexually and feeling diminished by the outstanding qualities of womens prudence and downtoearth survival kit and the maternal instinct to raise us well so to become contributing people to societys wellbeing ideally our rigid individualism in this still macho world ought to be blended  as  harmonious manwoman binomial opposites that are fully complementary by mutual consultation and respect and not requiring any one of them to be the nasty boss this no matter what the job is so we all may service and fill the needs at present and as best we can directions given by whoever has the training and title for it so equality and fairness are at work and the nasty courtland sykesdonald trumps of this world need not apply as they belong only to the fringes of a forthcoming enlightened society of equals trumps assault of everything noble in our souls and the encouragement of likebeasts to run for office is an outrage we all are shedevils now for good measure
1506,why are so many men like courtland sykes so afraid of women  real men dont need to be surrounded by weakness to feel strong  thanks mr kristof for once again displaying the best traits of masculinity
1507,nicholas please dont use this nut job as a representative of the backlash to the metoo movement brbras a father of a teenage son and two teenage daughters i want them all to be treated equally but just as i would never want anyone to sexually harass my daughters i also dont want someone to accuse my son without evidence of a sexual assault and ruin his life out of vengeance or on a whim brbrits wonderful that these centuryold issues are being taken so seriously but i fear too many on the metoo side are a little too comfortable with a climate where an accusation is a conviction using mr sykes as a straw man for your argument serves no useful purpose
1508,cortland sykes had a pretty transparent gameplan when he decided to run against claire mccaskillbrhow can i draw the attention and hopefully support of the president of the united statesbri know  i will articulate the most laughably draconian remarks imaginable about women that will get his attention and supportbrhe probably thought about running as a reformed pedophile in an effort to gain the presidents support  but saw that hand recently played without success
1509,a man who views womens equality as manhating is saying far more about his own sense of self worth than the worth of women
1510,this is the most misogynistic administration in my lifetime  defund planned parenthood destroy mandatory insurance coverage for contraception free health care providers to deny treatment they dont agree with and defund community health centers  now this yahoo says what republican men believe keep women barefoot and pregnant home cooking dinner  marches are good votes against republicans are necessary not optional  and theres another way to make the point  a womens sex strike on all republican men  start now before its too late
1511,thank you for writing this  weve come along way since the days when women were expected to be married right out of highschool  we now have more options than housewife teacher secretary nurse or nun  but there will always be those men who wish that the womens rights movement never happened  equality can never be taken for granted its something that must be worked for at for all our sakes
1512,i hope the script writers for the handmaids tale are reading this article they need material for season 2 
1513,democracy is not protected and promoted by standing or feeling resisting or following a herdbrit is nurtured and defended by education independent thinking knowledge of ones country and government and a good understanding how legal reform actually works
1514,im a 65 year old american male who grew up in a racist misogynistic midwest region not unlike the region courtland sykes hails from evidently his programming reflects my own women are to be treated with respect but not taken seriously their primary role is as wife and mother men should always maintain a superior role and therefore of course god has ordained that the man should be the head of the household brbrunlike mr sykes ive learned that much of my programming was in error over the years i have learned a great deal from the women in my life and i am now beginning to understand just how little i actually know and how much i still need to learn nevertheless the programming is still there buried deep within and i have spent decades in an effort to observe and correct vestigial traces of that programming that battle will no doubt continue as long as i am alive brbrthe problem in america today it seems is that many of us  men and women alike  refuse to acknowledge this programming and therefore find complete justification in shutting down any attempts to correct it brbrwe all know the phrase the first step in solving a problem is admitting that you have a problem and that is precisely why we must all work so hard to eradicate this cancerous imbalance from our culture  because there remain far too many americans who adamantly refuse to take that first stepbrbrand sadly many hold positions of inordinate power over our laws and our culture 
1515,amen mr kristoff ive been a feminist since my first girlfriend in high school showed me she was smarter tougher funnier and wiser than any of my male friends my mom was the same when it came to the men in the household as were many of my friends moms my motherinlaw is one of the most awesome people youd ever want to meet she taught about the history of the struggle for womens rights im a lucky and richer man for getting it that women are 12 the equation for the best for humankind i mean really whos kidding who trump is a man who doesnt know or care to know about anything other than how to get what he wants  money fame and power  whatever the price in other words hes like a lot of guys who see how well a patriarchy works for men who want to get ahead and know how to exploit their social advantages keep up the hreat work
1516,im delighted that this column referenced concern over distinguishing between al frankens behavior and weinsteins a concern i share as secondary too much of the media seizes on such criticism as opposition rather than arguments to appropriately focus the metoo movement and to maintain its credibility of course major trouble within the ranks makes for more exciting news than a discussion of an organizations real mission
1517,nicholas i disagree with your statement that to know how to distinguish between the harvey weinsteins and the al frankens is important but those controversies are secondarybrbrfeminism is the multifaceted face of the war between the sexes i agree that ex is but one aspect but seduction is the freeform art that sets the stage for all prejudices and misunderstandings between men and women it is only when a man or a woman or both do not coincide on that playing field of sexual interplay that trouble arises whether the aggressor is a man or a woman makes no differencebrbrall issues arise from how two people feel about each other sexually attraction or repulsion is the background of all human relations only when participants set aside the reptilian mind reactions to each other is advance possible in all other fields of interaction between them brbrthe war between the sexes might be redefined by setting aside attraction or repulsion removing emotion from the search for equality in politics the work arena and religion sex politics and religion are the domains of conflict and strife conflict is here to stay we are human this war can only be modified not solvedbrbrfeminism seeks modification this should not destroy the rush of attraction but instead recognize and accept its difference from unwanted aggression
1518,it always cracks me up to see childcare framed as a womens issue  men have children too and are probably equally concerned about who will take care of them while they are at work  it just shows how ingrained gender inequality really is when even our defenders dont recognize their bias  otherwise i appreciate the intention of the piece
1519,feminism today like so many large groups is a starling murmurationbrbrfeminism today like virtually every other large and human group gathering appears to be organization at a low level of mentalbehavioral complexity higher human organization seems to depend on higher intelligence and flexibility of behavior as seen in superior sports teams the best music groups the must successful businesses government projects such as nasabrbrbut feminism today appears to parallel so many other collective organizations not to mention the two major political parties by enforcing a tightness of behavior and thoughtthat thought has correspondence in the body and viceversa complete repudiation of cartesian duality separation between body and mindwhich of course adds up to conformity and still more conformitybrbrthis cannot help but combine and clash with other collective movements which themselves follow the same pattern the entire effect looking over the large group clashes in america today is as if witnessing starling murmuration groups smashing into each other separating recombining but still always at rather low level of complexity with respect to thought and behavior brbrit just doesnt seem to bode well if we consider american democracy a project toward higher overall complexity and higher relationship between individual body and mind of course there is no going backward but it would be nice if we get a much more clear science of human social systems development 
1520,history is on your our side mr kristof  please continue to use your voice that touches so many to inspire our fight at the local and state level 
1521,most men support womens rights unfortunately there are those that want to keep women barefoot and pregnant this is another reason to support more women running for officebrbrwe wont have true equality until we have at least as many women as men serving as elected officials vote progressive in all local state amp national elections
1522,another great article mr kristof i want to address one thing in this article you indirectly take issue with the dehumanizing language mysongists are using to reference to feminists thank you however you also dehumanize in a less harsh way melania trump by referring to her as betrayed wife no 3 shes been reduced to her treatment and relationship to a man as a feminist who struggles with melanias life choices i believe that if we are going to achieve the promise of feminism  equality for all humans we have to also be outraged when any acts of dehumanization are used  even towards people we disagree with or dont like and we certainly must work to not engage in this practice ourselves
1523,as hrc said womens right are human rights   some men like to cook and enjoy parenting some women are great in business you need to be smart and fair  to understand gender equality is good for everyone
1524,conducting oneself with resolve and integrity despite danger and defamation until equal rights are achieved  to me there was always a double meaning to womens suffrage
1525,of course there will be disagreemetns about policies or about where to draw lines  about what to make of aziz ansari and how to distinguish between the harvey weinsteins and the al frankens but those controversies are secondarybrbrsecondary not for me i support any mechanism including quotas that will help more power achieve more positions of power which in the long run is what will sort of lot of these problems out however i will never forget how many of my collegeeducated liberal female friends brushed aside our central societal lynchpin of due process lives and careers could be ruined overnight merely by collective judgment in the court of public opinion my childhood experiences led to me to despise two things bullies in pants or skirts and false accusations so while i will continue to fully support womens rights i will not be standing with any shedevils
1526,you ask why is a man writing this column while i agree with you that womens rights arent just a womans issue any more than civil rights were just a black issue and support and appreciate your using the space youve been given to write movingly and convincingly on the topic i think theres more to it a man is also writing this column in part because well men simply get more chances to write columns than do women or for that matter nonbinary people the question then becomes whats the best way to solve this problem how do we tear down patriarchy
1527,thanks for the article please note however that progress has not been enormous in the matter of our elected representatives gender compared to most other countries it has been abysmal 
1528,nicholas kristof seems to support the metoo movement which has been shaming men in the media for alleged cases of sexual harassment  yes women should be protected from sexual violence but men should also be protected from false accusations from having their lives destroyed by media which are quick to judge before the facts have been fully ascertainedbrbrthe metoo movement also neglects a serious problem in american society  if men of power do sometimes abuse women it is also the case that there are millions of poor men without jobs who die early of cancer because they cannot afford cancer screeningsbrbrthere are also women dying because they cannot afford health care  becoming homeless is often a twostep process  first one loses a house and lives in a camper then one loses even that  the intermediate step is described in nomandland a recent book by jessica bruderbrbrwhile women complain about discrimination in the workplace the camper people are discriminated by upstanding democrats as well as republicansbrbrin my community it is illegal to park a camper anywhere so far as i can tell except on your own property  this keeps those becoming homeless invisible  they build communities out in the desertbrbrwhile wealthy movie stars complain that some producer hit on them the homeless lose their teeth because of lack of dental carebrbrliberals have forgotten the truly poor many of whom wind up in prison  the us has 14 times the incarceration rate of japan
1529,a new quinnipiac poll finds that 72 percent of republicans consider trump a good role model for childrenbrbrmy late fathera lifelong loyal politically active republican evangelicalis turning over in his grave
1530,an astonishing 390 women are now running for congress this will be the test in view of the rancor and political blindness now being exhibited by the republicans in congress i hope the 390 represent a positive turn around we need it badly
1531,72 percent of republicans consider trump a good role model for childrenbrbrthere has never been better proof that it is time for the gop to go the way of the whigs the party they replaced back when they represented americas left wing and were truly the party of lincoln brbrthere comes a point where the compromise of decency and truth in the pursuit of power within a democracy crosses a line  obviously trump crossed that line long before he became president now the gop has crossed it with their unwavering support of this monster forgiving everything he does and turning on any institution that may try to reign him in regardless of facts brbrimpeach the gop
1532,well done mr kristof today i am proud to acknowledge you as a fellow oregonian
1533,thank you for speaking out on behalf of our shared humanity
1534,amen  this is not a zero sum game  men are more if women are more  culture and societal norms are all enriched if women are more  the future of the human race and of the planet are made more secure if women are more
1535,women need the support of men at home at the workplace and everywhere else they live their lives women can not win the fight for fairness and equality by themselves i believe if more men were like mr kristof we would not even be having this discussion one of the goals of right wing republicans seems to be the marginalizing minimalizing and outright demonizing of their female opponents this only adds to an already hostile environment felt by most women today 
1536,as a filipino i have watched with deep sadness as the united states a country i considered to be one of the worlds leaders in issues of human rights and equality elected donald trump having elected our own misogynistic warmongering wouldbe dictator duterte we can relate its good to know that at least this one good thing is coming out of the trump presidency the continuing growth evolution and acceptance of feminism not as a radical ideology but as the sane humane norm 
1537,having grown up in a family where the women had huge personalities and the men were relatively passive i find the narrative of a demure and obeisant female race dating back to antiquity to be more of a modern myth than a sociological realitybrbri am sure that brash bold intellectually selfpossessed women have existed since the beginning of the human species and have very often found ways to make their social settings work for thembrbrthe ones who really are strong and powerful dont need a lot of help asserting themselves  the ones who need a lot of help asserting themselves maybe just arent readybrbrif i have a daughter i dont think i will teach her that women have always been oppressed and only now after hundreds of thousands of years are they starting to have a chance to be heard  that ideology is a curse and a lie  i would teach her that women have always found a way to speak meaningfully in different ways depending on their own personal strengths
1538,feminism is simply a belief that men and women should be equal and arent stuck in preconceived roles if courtland sykes fiance wants to have a hot dinner waiting for her man when he strolls through the door after a long day of work more power to her its not about hating men its about having the power to choose and being supported in said choicebrbrthe problem is when men assume all women have been put on this earth to serve them and then get offended when some of them would rather do something else suddenly those women are maneating harpies evil shrews and ready to do away with men the moment they find a way to procreate on their own basically these men dont take rejection wellbrbri always appreciate mr kristofs point of view because hes been fighting for womens rights and equality since before it was en vogue or a hashtag for every man like courtland sykes or donald trump there are an increasing number of men like mr kristof and my husband who happily shares the housework with me despite the far more lucrative job and would make a wonderful stayathome dad should the opportunity arise 
1539,his views about women are obviously detestable but im equally disgusted by his slogan visible in the picture missouri is the real america this pernicious rhetoric has been around for a long time i recall that sarah palin made a lot of use of it in small midwestern towns in 2008 it should be resisted and contradicted whenever it occurs all of us whatever our ethnicity class gender sexual orientation or any other demographic  including the state and the size of the town we live in  are equally real americans
1540,mr kristof what do you think those 72 of republicans who think that denigrating don is a good role model for children think of your column if they ever read it
1541,thank you for this timely message nickbrbri just made donations to claire mccaskill maria cantrell and elizabeth warren
1542,the unfortunate reality is that there is a mr sykes around every corner of our social political and economical aspect of our society all those sykes live in our universe and not in a parallel one time has come to catapult them away to where they belong
1543,and yet this mouth breather has a fiancee a woman born in our modern time is  perfectly willing to live within the constraints sykes defines 
1544,too bad i dont work in a place where people value women in management as much as men off to go work in support of my supervisor who lacks two thirds of my credentials his ba to my mpa and jd and outearns me by a significant amount hell happily go on taking credit for my work without ever acknowledging its my work not his and ill count the days until retirement
1545,i am a 73 year old woman  i married in the 1960s  we sacrificed more money for me to be a stayathome mom  my suggestion to men if they want a wife to be stayathome dinner at 5 then they have to earn more money  families cannot survive on one income unless they are in the top 10 of society  if women have to work then pay wages that give families the option of having one of the spouses stay at homebrbri worked all of my life until retirement except those 5 years i stayed at home with my son  i never earned as much money as my husband although he was a factory worker and i was a nurse rn
1546,how is hillary clintons life a wreckbrbrshe was a successful lawyer  she married a president and worked along side him  she was a senator and a secretary of state  she was within a breath of the presidency  she is many times a millionaire  she has the attention of the world and anytime she wants to speak the media will run towards her at a wave of her wrist  she has a successful foundation doing her bidding  she has met or has had friendships with thousands of the worlds most interesting people  she has a daughter who appears to share love with herbrbrif hers is a failed life because she did not achieve everything to which she aspired i doubt if there any successful ones
1547,whenever people ask me how can i be a feminist i respond how can i not and have any selfrespect i also have 3 daughters and 2 sons and 2 young granddaughters and 1 grandson people like sykes would have me count only my 2 sons and one grandson as people while being content for the least rights and opportunities for my daughters and granddaughters perhaps i am supposed to hope they meet good owners sykes belongs in the trashheap of history along with slaveholders
1548,frederick douglass the great 19th century abolitionist also spoke up for woman suffrage asked why he said something to the effect relying on memory here what i do for my race i do for my self what i do for women has some nobility in it so glad to have kristof speaking up for women in 2018 and 390 women running for congress november 2018 will be a game changer
1549,many women and some men were horrified that a man who boasted of sexual assault could be elected presidentbrbrbefore we get too carried away with a female revolt and uprising remember that 54 of the white female vote went to trump and this was well after revelations about his beliefs attitudes and past behavior it is a fact that unfortunately the large white female voting block is a trump strength and will need to somehow be overcome next election
1550,i hope that courtland sykes loses to senator mccaskillbrbrand then i hope that mr sykes gets married has daughters and that those daughters grow up to be strong independent women who straighten out their neanderthal dad
1551,thank you for your claritylets keep up the political pressure and continue to focus on actions that are intersectional and progressive
1552,the key phrase here is backlash a window into the backlash against metoobrbrthis clown sykes would no doubt have had the same loony opinions regardless however it would have made him a freak at the margins until we got into backlashbrbrpolitics works like a pendulum the further it swings the further it swings backbrbrit is a great thing to make a lot of progress all in one rush however if the ground taken cannot be held then overreach produces less progress than taking less in the first place but holding that ground once taken brbrthat is the danger now it is those who risked excess as in taking down al franken not those who took down the worst cases like harvey weinstein it costs far more than the guy like franken it costs the backlash against doing itbrbrit is exactly because this movement is right and important that caution should be exercised not to mess it up by going too far too fast
1553,confronting the general tendency to defer to male selfconfidence rather than female expertise brbrthank you  brbrthis is the core of the what women face every daybrbr exemplified by the election of trump whose campaign policy statements amounted to i know more about isis than the generals and youre going to like it believe me over a policy wonk woman who presented detailed proposalsbra hrefhttpswwwhillaryclintoncomissues titlehttpswwwhillaryclintoncomissues targetblankhttpswwwhillaryclintoncomissuesabrthat were ignored as if they were irrelevant to being presidential
1554,i feel for sykes daughters if he currently has any amp pray that he never has more it seems that like trump the man has low self esteem and major insecurity clearly he is threatened by those of us who happen to have two x chromosomes 
1555,i think youve missed the real story here  clearly courtland sykes is not a real candidate but the first ai bot to run for office  his published statements sound just like the pseudorandom political gibberish of a twitter bot and his campaign posters and slogans inspirobot could do a better job  even his name and his fiances name for that matter sound like something made up by baby name genie  
1556,since mr sykes is now free to say what he thinks others are free to answer him instead of talking around the issue and no one can plausibly claim that people like him exist only in the overheated imaginations of feminists  a mixture of rage and mockery seem indicated  
1557,thank you mr kristof for always elevating women either in this country or in other culturesthe support for shedevils is growing exponentially in this country and now even in muslim countriesthe new york times had an article just days ago about three women graduates of the naval academy who are running for congress this yearthey cleared the hurdle for entry to the academy and active duty and now will be shedevils serving us in congresswomen have so many admirable role models todayfor someone who grew up in the era of dinner on the table by five it is very inspiring
1558,i have never had a sister or a daughter but i know if we do not turn back those who believe they can tell a woman how to live her life there will be far too many generations of pain  if an elected official cannot understand this we have a duty to remove them from power i am a father and a husband and my sons know this
1559,thank you for sharing your perspective on the backlash  i have noticed a trend for some young women that want take their husbands names be taken care of and told how to make decisions  this saddens me and makes me fear a reverse in forward progress on womens rights  dano50 is right on  men cannot be free if women arent liberated  the future generations will determine the value of women i feel a change will be coming  
1560,i dont understand how people can criticize another persons identity as made up  isnt that the whole point is that we create our own identities one woman doesnt even get to decide what being a woman means for another woman its not just obnoxious sexism its like they cant even grasp the idea of flexibility within an identity group literally campaigning on a platform revealing intellectual inferiority thats where we arebrbrand calling him an acolyte of trump is skipping over the mo governor that is probably the missing link between the two  
1561,my father had a job which caused him to leave at dawn to get to the can plant where he managed the warehouse my mother kept dinner warmed for him when he came home late i made desserts which he ate and said were swell  my mother grandmother and aunts went movies in town and to plays in sf my grandfather came to like going to plays in the city  i dont remember any conversations about women or their rights the women in my family had all the rights they wanted  it was a tolerant family i came home and lectured every one about the war in vietnam and voters rights the family listened my father said that he would rather have me doing those normal things when i was young and passionate than have me become cynical  perhaps the fact that both sides of the family had irish antecedents made them more tolerant of protest  perhaps it is wise to let young people follow their passions without critiques it is the last time they are truly free to shout out and march no jobs or kids  if they continue to march later in life good on them
1562,men cannot be free if women are not free let the white male patriarchy die let all people of all genders and colors know real freedom and equality
1563,thank you
1564,ok we get it the msndnc have decided gender is their winning issue for the mid terms you can also hope for an economic downturn   
1565,thank you nick kristof for writing not only this piece but for your coverage of human including womens rights issues over the years though its disheartening to read about the courtland sykeses who endure in our country your message that men need to step up to the plate is spot on we need more hedevils like you
1566,thank you as always for supporting women we cannot do this alone the good men out there need to stand with us or there will not be meaningful and long lasting change why arent more of the good men speaking out and stepping up 
1567,as recently as 1987 only half of americans said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or stickbrbrreference please  brbrkristof has never written about a man murdered by his wifepartner unless of course he can ascribe the murder to the man and completely exonerate the woman nor has he written about the wholesale condemnation of men under socalled domestic violence laws the vast majority of which involve no violence whatsoever that leaves leaves them homeless without their children and in many instances jailedbrbr sykes is correct about the insidious effects of feminism on individuals and society thankfully the promoters of shedevils have had their run and more and more people are telling them to take a hike 
1568,thank you for this i grew up with a scandinavian mother who didnt believe in taking a back seat to any man her mother was a dressmaker who contributed to the family finances at a time when few women did so because of their role models i never felt like i should fade into the background around men its a battle that i have fought my entire life and continue to fight i am happy to see younger women taking a stand its easy to become complacent when someone else has done the fighting 
1569,a new quinnipiac poll finds that 72 percent of republicans consider trump a good role model for childrenbrbrand that ladies and gentlemen probably says it all
1570,seven paragraphs seems like a lot of space to devote to a candidate who has not been endorsed by donald trump and who seems unlikely to be elected and there is a later reference to men like sykesbrbrperhaps it is because mr sykes views are so strikingly unpalatable but the argument of the article might be stronger if the author had chosen a target who is less of a straw man and more obviously representative of those whom he wishes to criticize of course a sample of one is still not all that compelling 
1571,excellent article there are some who still believe that women have a place in the kitchen in bed or doing her husbands bidding or any bidding but her own i was fortunate i grew up with a father who was a professor in a high ranking medical school my mother was a nurse and my stepmother was also a doctor in the medical schoolbrbri assumed my life would follow a similar pattern never mind that my stepmother described staff meetings as bull pens and that she was fortunate to have a man my father to stand by her in case anybody thought she might not be as qualified as a man brbrin my life as a journalist there were times three decades ago when a guy i was interviewing said i should be home with the kids home making dinner for hubby or anything but what i was doing  getting more front page stories than most of the other staffersbrbrprogress but many steps more to march  brbrsignedbrbrshe devil and proud of it
1572,respect for differences seems to have largely vanished in todays hyperpartisan usa extremists vilify opponents and only listen to their leftwing or rightwing echo chambers and respective thinktanks moderates everywhere may want to consider others as different not less
1573,if courtland sykes ever has daughters and they want to be career obsessed what does he plan to do disown them
1574,i too stand with the shedevils  crass backward rhetoric out of sykes  sad and pathetic stuff  brbrthe thing that concerns me about skyes and his like is that in these trump times the spectrum of what is ok to say out loud never mind as a us senate candidate is being expanded so that even if sykes doesnt get elected the point of what is acceptable is pushed further to the extreme thus normalizing what would have only a couple years ago be considered shameful and derogatory  brbris this really where peoples hearts are at these days  i just cannot understand this hard liner republican approach and what they hope to gain in the long term  kitchen and the bedroom  ughbrbrwomen deserve better  the country deserves better   we need to make some changes and with the elections coming later in the year i hope it comes soon   
1575,for all of my 43years ive heard men try to tell women and sometimes specifically me how be not too shrill not too ambitious not too muscular not too foulmouthed welldressed hwp good at making dinner by 6pm and take care not to be a knowitall read question your male colleaguesbrbrsykes is the kind of guy that is alltoowilling to continue that trend even though we are now living in an age when it is perfectly ok to question this kind of patriarchical condescension and to laugh at it as women men like him were very confusing when i was a young woman because no one was writing columns like this no one was questioning the fact that maybe women and girls didnt want to be put neatly into categories brbri am so grateful to be living in a time when i can openly thumb my nose and worse at guys like him and im grateful for men like nicholas kristof who will back us up the future looks bright for everyone regardless of gender 
1576,390 is good there should be more than 535 women running id say less than 1070 is too few
1577,i stand with the shedevilsbrbrfrom 72 year old seattleite married with 6 grandchildren and pretty centrist leaning
1578,three cheers for this well crafted rant nick i was very fortunate to have grown up in a household with a father who also expected his woman to have dinner waiting on the table at 6 and with a mother who quickly cleared up that guys misunderstandings fair and balanced with deep respect for each person was the norm for every decision task and responsibility in my house as it should be in all relationships throughout our society i also work in a field conservation science that was once dominated by males but that is increasingly the domain of dynamic women the university classes i teach on this topic are also almost completely filled with very attentive and dedicated women students and each term this trend gives me more confidence that we can have a future with a habitable earth 
1579,heck mo is the population center of the country now in that we are all moving to cali as slowly as it is moving northward  i think sam clemmens home is a fine one from which to roam
1580,not sure you read the article mattie
1581,according to pew women already make the majority of family financial and household decisionsparticularly for big family matters and big ticket items by almost 2 to 1 as for outside the home 52 of white women who possess a lot of the entitlement and privilege in our society voted for trump so while feminist myths shall persist perhaps the trouble with our species is that women already have too much influence sexist remarks that men are to blame is nothing more than chauvinism
1582,jake you should have gotten a nyt pick  everyone here gets on board with a point of view and because they dont challenge themselves with contrasting opinions they assume theirs will fly with the general population  feminists liberals this paperall need to ask themselves what is the fly in the ointment  what are our most vulnerable judgments  is there anything we might be a tad hypocritical about  its important to dig deeper than just singing to the choir cause whats blindspotted can cost an election
1583,you might feel differently if you had been the victim of a sexual assault and nothing were done about it  yes you might be very very angry if you were told that thats just the way it is and you should just get over it
1584,dont forget who that war hero put next in line for the presidency  all women are not equally qualified
1585,nope nothing in the water just slimy opportunists taking advantage of the moment to grab for power brbrits disheartening that missouri gets more than its share of wingnuts the horrors of ferguson the idiocy of todd akin the hubris and hypocrisy of conservative navy seal greitens etc make me wish to move to some other state one where equality rules black lives matter elected representatives reflect their constituents working for their improved lives and nothing bad ever happensbrbrwhere was that state again 
1586,as a missouri progressive  yes there is such a thing  actually a lot of us  im delighted to see the rightwing running candidates like sykes making the opposing choices crystal clear  would love to see him win the primary although his likely opponent our ag josh hawley just put his foot in his mouth about human trafficking too  go claire
1587,travel around rural mo amp judge for yourself  this is why the state is red
1588,i do  at least its not kansas
1589,which part of education independent thinking knowledge of ones country and government and a good understanding how legal reform actually works does trump the executive order machine do
1590,about the same as the spineless democratic party mike zero generally except that trump more frequently makes large strides into negative territorybrbrby the way i wonder which part of a slavish devotion to the decrepit and corrupt two party duopoly you imagine is doing anything at all to help america brbrdemocrats who refuse to lift a finger against trumps emoluments tax returns and conflicts of interest because they are so busy instead feeling so pc and so good at standing up and accomplishing nothing tangible except being door mats for the gop
1591,thank you for your candid admission and for trying every day to be a better person
1592,good for youbrbri find i still struggle this way with racism  it is also deeply programmed into us and i grew up with nonracist parents too  i cant imagine how hard it must be for people who grow up with racism
1593,insightful and gutsy thanks
1594,only a total moron would want women barefoot and pregnant its been decades since i have heard anyone say or propose this with any seriousness why is this ancient straw woman being trotted out againbr     equality is a worthy and nearly achieved goal  last night i watch pbs news female anchor all female reporters all female talking heads and two female experts at the end to suss it all out not a male in the entire production looked like 1955 in exact reverse
1595,liz thanks  i too have had struggles with melanias life choices but ive become much more sympathetic toward her in recent weekshow much can one poor woman be made to pay for some bad decisions  one hopes she can raise her son to be better than his cruel slob of a father  shes going to need a strong real man in her life
1596,many women also have self confidence problems not all but when it rears its ugly head as mens lack does we demand that terms used for females be respectful less honest amp required letting us use our i am less than please help me dont say any woman has made choices less than optimum like being an illegal alien you hook onto a rich man who is a pig which gets you an easy citizenship amp no fear of deportation but being married to a male like this is no fun so to make you feel better everyone must pander to your lack of confidence never saying she is betrayed wife 3 which she is hes had 2 others slept around on all his wives its the same as saying hes president of the usa a title he is reduced to nothing but a title for which his actions makes him unintitled to but thats ok hes a man women must still be coddledbrim 65 disabled amp female ive spent too long doing things i should let others do for me because i am female hear me roar then when i cant do it i must demean myself amp ask for help that had been offered first that i had spurned why because i am a woman hubby broke his ankle badly years ago he had no trouble asking for the help he needed so why should i because feminists have been screaming do it yourself dont be a weakling in my ears for decades i have come to hope loud feminists all should break a leg at some point amp have to totally take care of themselves no help allowed then go back to yelling or not 
1597,some men cant cook but when their wives become disabled through illness or accident have to learn that amp many other women only chores mine did came back from our honeymoon on crutches hubby could burn water toast was almost beyond him i would write a receipe down for him telling him they were like directions in products that must be put together he was always good at those things hed still come in each time he used a receipe amp ask me for help how many times do you have to explain put 12 chicken in pan with a little butter on top put in oven at 350 for one hour now i am permenantly disabled amp he is a great cook though every once in a while he has an attack of lack of confidence i yell from where i am often writing here you can do it i have confidence in you
1598,perhaps not but youve just accepted someone elses definition for everyone of your gendersex
1599,this sounds like a principaled stance but im not entirely sure it is you say you will support anything that helps women achieve positions of power except a movement where in the effort to expose the thousands and thousands of instances where womens lives and careers have been unfairly destroyed by men that movement is unfair to a single man brbri agree that both franken and ansari were railroaded unfairly and i think as with anything this effort to expose sexual harrassment and assault as a constant in womens lives needs to be more careful but you are effectively saying that nothing is worth the possibility of a rush to judgement even though women have been effectively silenced for years and years and years by rushes to judgement thats a pretty high bar to set so that you will be on board with the exposure of a serious problem in our society brbrmaybe you should consider rethinking i think you can speak up about going too far within the context of supporting the basic premise of the movement 
1600,how could the league possibly refuse this offer  
1601,so then the execs can be like yeahwe will sit down and listen to you and then do nothing suit settled 
1602,i would not want to play chess against these cheerleaders lawyersnice move
1603,could the cheerleaders join the actors equity association or another similar performance union an effort for collective representation would do much more to address cheerleader pay and working conditions than a few hour meeting with roger goodell 
1604,seeking conclusions which support preconceived ideas and discarding the data which does not is mr pruitts idea of science we would still be in the dark ages using this approach  science is not political and the truth will always be discovered the science the measurements the study design and the statistical analysis are all difficult and i doubt most will understand the subtleties certainly congress will not understand the science since they are not even reading the bills they pass i have not doubt that mr pruitt does not
1605,pruitt  first eliminate the scientists and now eliminate the sciencebrbrthe number of people that will consider this new epa policy as good news will  sadly be way too many  the idea of using less science to protect the environment should never be proposed or be dismissed at first glance  by using the red herring that the data must be open to the public is just the type of misdirection that the gop is really good at  in this case it will eliminate the need to actually perform any type of environmental protectionbrbr mr pruitt said the measure would allow the public to test scientists findings for themselvesbrbrthe public can analyze years of data from multiple studies and multiple scientists on any subject on some casual day and determine what should be done to protect the environment  i dont really think that is plausible  sound bites are now considered as policybrbrall a company needs to do now is declare any type of data or analysis as proprietary and the epa cant even use it no matter how damaging it may be to people and the planet 
1606,this is a shameful attack on the environment and on research that uses human subjects what pruitt is asking is impossible which gives him one more opportunity to destroy air and water hes pathologically destructivebrbrrepublicans sit back and let this man do their bidding they are defined by greed and intentional lack of knowledge its indefensible 
1607,it gives people the opportunity in real time to peer review it goes to the heart of what we should be about as an agency mr pruitt saidbrbri dont think he understands what peer means peers are experts in their fields something that the public by definition is not and therefore cannot do peer review i love my oncology friends and they are all very smart but i doubt any one of them could peer review and astrophysics paper
1608,given recent revelations about mr pruitts motivations and long held mo it wouldnt seem that transparency is a concept that hes all that familiar with or that his policies are so we little people can be part of the decision process  brbrhes he has no scientific qualifications for his role and i suspect most of jane and john q public dont have the qualifications required to understand analyze and opine on scientific study data
1609,i loved this review without wanting to actually eat anything served i think i would prefer the autumn menu it reminded me of when i was in beijing at the wanfujing night market a few years ago and my chinese friend asked another chinese passing by with fried starfish on a stick whether is was good in response the woman broke off a piece and handed it to her my friend said it tasted like crab but it smelled darkly funky and fishy and of course we dont usually eat the entire hardshelled crab but necessity has driven taste before and will again the way the environment is going
1610,paulbrbrhaving a different perspective andor opinion does not make one a hater brbrthis is a beautifully written review and for those of us who cannot dream of a 375 meal either here or in denmark not to mention the airfare it is a lovely escape 
1611,thank you for this mr wells nicely donebrits not for everyone so now lets sadly brace for the haters 
1612,the best kind of restaurant review you answered many of the questions i had and between the writing and the photography i almost feel like i have been to this amazing quirky place
1613,did this remind me of joyce brbryesbrbrdid i enjoy itbrbrwell done mr wells 
1614,smithiebri completely agree with you i enjoyed the escape just as much and dont know when ill make it there if at all i refer to those who seem to ritually pick these pieces apart at the mere mention of a price they cant rationalize or the level of detail these artists go to to present something as best they possibly can for the enjoyment of those who are willing to pay to appreciate itbrthose who make it their mission to try and convince we who find this kind of thing wonderful and worthwhile that were selfish and indulgent that food is for sustenance only and to remind as that there are children starving in africabreach to their own i say no offense intended smithie  
1615,the iran nuclear deal does nothing but postpone the inevitable  all it does is postpone irans nuclear program for 10 years then the deal goes away than what negotiate a new pact i agree with president donald j trump the deal needs to be scrapped and iran forced back to the bargaining table the outcome of new deal must include no nuclear weapons ever withdrawal of iranian forces from where ever they are in the world and end their association with hezbollah thank you
1616,macron and every other world leader must be aware that whatever agreement they think they come to can and will be undone by the toxic personalities on fox who trump gives more credibility to than our intelligence agencies mr macron will be embarrassed by trump sure as everyone else in his coterie has been 
1617,enjoy the enfant terrible mr macronbrbrdont forget to change his dirty diapers
1618,vive la diffrence
1619,trump is threatening the iran deal and iran directlybrtalk about a man who speaks with a forked tonguebrone minute he wants out of the middle east and the next minute he says that iran will never restart their nuclear program which means some form of involvement in the middle eastbrnever having been a diplomat before you would think that he should look to europe for guidance but that would mean that he would have to think and that would be a problem
1620,washington  president trump on tuesday decried the nuclear agreement with iran as a terrible deal that failed to restrain threats from tehran but said he would use formal meetings with president emmanuel macron of france to discuss whether to preserve itbrbri hope he has a good french baby sitter
1621,im sure that trumps tart will be the best ever  as for the insane ridiculous nuclear accord trump will undoubtedly trample it as he has done to so many of the accomplishments of the previous administration  who knows perhaps he can have an arm wrestling contest with macron at dinner  im sure he wants to get even for losing the death grip with macron when he visited francebran aside    the revolutionary war costumes worn by american troops in front of the white house remind me of nixons secret servicepalace guard uniforms  both nixon and trump aspired to be the imperial presidencies  lets hope that the similarities extend to other things as well   
1622,he needs a warto distract and to rally people to him  a war is likely the only way he and his party win the next elections   im sure there are republicans who know this but have made a faustian bargain to hold onto power in addition it will largely not be their kids in harms way but the children of the working class  so theyll be able to ignore the bodies  as for trump he doesnt care who has to go down to satisfy his ego 
1623,well at least theres one party that behaves diplomatically and knows how to flatter his narcissistic host  i just hope this isnt the end of a budding friendship with trump cancelling the iran deal and then threatening to return the statue of liberty as well  
1624,bonne chance emmanuel macron you are being subjected to the most boorish behavior by mrtrumphe fawns over you and acts as though you are his great friendhis behavior is an embarrassment mr macronwe wish you luck in making him hear your concerns and hope that your superior judgment on the iran treaty and cooperation on climate change will somehow prevailin the european tradition you take a world viewmr trump has a narrowunited states centric obsessionhe forgets our loyal allies who have come to our side many times
1625,one has to wonder  does trump have even a basic understanding of the iran deal it appears that his main interest in tearing up the deal is based on his hatred of president obama
1626,truly the most disgusting display of faux bromance ive ever seenand trumps mini parade utterly absurdwhy does trump do that aggressivepull victim inhand shakeeveryday he becomes more ludicrous and he will make macron a fool when he says no to reupping iran deal
1627,like that will go over well when you have to talk to north korea in a few weeks good job trump you made a fool of yourself no one is going to trust you anymore 
1628,in business mr trump negotiated hard cut deals and ultimately when his projects spectacularly failed cut his losses abandoned his partners stiffed people he owed money too and used courts and bankruptcy to walk away he personally come out ahead while everyone else lost brbrone wonders whether he understands what will happen in the middle east and world security if follows the same trajectory in dealing with iran and their nuclear ambitions
1629, all it does is postpone irans nuclear program for 10 years then the deal goes away than what negotiate a new pact where is your brain if you tear up the deal what are you going to do negotiate a new pact well guess what whatever your plan is you can tear up the deal and do it tomorrow or wait ten years and do exactly the same thing and if you tear it up tomorrow how are you going to get russia china and europe on board with new sanctions  tearing it up would be really really dumb
1630,but thats where we were before iran had a nuclear weapons program that the world wanted to curtail  and we came to an agreementbrbrtrump people always assume that trump has successfully accomplished something before it is started  for example trump was going to fix healthcare and look at what we got  trump was going to have a responsible spending bill but it adds over a trillion dollars to the national debt and soaks the middle class and benefits the rich  trump was going to pull out of syria but that is an unknown  trump was going to bring the best people to work in his administration and over a dozen of them have been kicked out  trump was going to build an expensive wall with mexico for which mexico was going to pay and now if there is a wall we will pay for itbrbrso what makes you think that any reset negotiation that trump would have with iran would have anywhere near an ideal outcome  why dont you wait to see if north korea gets to keep its nuclear weapons
1631,toronto is a great city in a great country our prayers are with you 
1632,how many of these incidents need occur before manufacturers are going to be held responsible for failing to introduce a safety feature that shuts down a vehicles engine when a frontside impact occurs
1633,oh canada our hearts are with you
1634,richmond hill is a separate municipality north of toronto  its not a neighbourhood though in the gta the greater toronto area
1635,lets hear from the gun loversbrbrnow we should ban vansbrbrlets confiscate all the vansbrbrwe get it youve made your point you love guns more than you love human life
1636,while i dont agree with many gun rights advocates this is a strawman argument the gun represents a tool with which when kept and borne by the citizenry natural liberties are ensured and secured it is not love of the gun but love of liberty that motivated the second amendments creation furthermore there are many things that people do value above their life including faith family and of course liberty the founding fathers embodied such a belief  give me liberty or give me death that said critiques can certainly be made of these positions that dont require misrepresenting the other side of the argument 
1637,when they say this to me i point out that i am all for banning humans from driving cars its just a matter of present practicality once upon a time we needed to have guns to protect our homesteads and wagon trains from wild animalsbrigands and hunt for our food now we dont in the near future it will be practical to simply let the machines drive us and then we can ban human driven cars too
1638,what about when a robot becomes better at raising children or making laws although rights can be reasonably interpreted and limited with respect to their practical application in no way is the very existence of a right predicated on said convenience or practicality 
1639,if trump understood irony he would be bemused by the fact that he is advocating someone else drop out because they are facing tough scrutiny 
1640,of course the white house did little or no vetting of his background before announcing his nomination on twitter then when if all fails epically blame someone else trump 101 
1641,donald trumpa metapolitician who sees all politics at the farthest end of the spectrum between substance and posturing who has never bothered to master any subject before blurting out his opinion of itblames the democrats for his own careless choice of a candidate to lead the va brbrha thats rich
1642,my job is being a decent person and a good citizen believe me i feel like drinking on the job now too 
1643,does anybody in the white hosue do any checking up on the people that are nominated before it goes forward to a confirmation hearingbrbrobviously mr trump doesnt work on anything other that gut feelings his wallet his ego and libido but arent there any people steering this ship
1644,at the time of dr jacksons address to the press re donald trumps health someone asked me what my impressions of him were  i said you mean besides the line of coke he did before facing the press there were many reasons for my remark the first was that mds never speak in a triphammer fashion as dr jackson did for well over an hour  and yes there are lots of reasons for a flannel mouth he mumbled i need water on minute 1430 of the youtube video of that performance only minutes into his remarks print news had facial closeups of him and those were very telling of someone under the influence of alcohol and drugs  knowing little more about him than his earned titles ruled out most relevant metabolic disorders most of which take time for absences for recovery or adjustments that would certainly have prevented meeting his academic and professional schedules and so his achievements  but for those of us who have worked in the area of chemical useabuse  and whose personal life is one of four decades of continuously straightsober living  a florid blotchy complexion rapid speech without flight of ideas or tangential patterns negative reports of workplace behavior controlled substance drug accountability and sloppiness is a pattern that smacks of polysubstance abuse id bet my life  and decades of work in behavioral education teaching  that rear admiral ronny jackson md looks talks and behaves like a duck for only one reason     
1645,round bout now dr ronny jackson is thinking if id just said no mr president i like my present job mr president i might have flown under the radar until i retired now im exposed and more than likely on the youre fired list and its all the fault of those darn democrats  brbrwhen trump suggested a promotion dr jackson should have said no thanks mr president and run for the nearest door
1646,mistake corrected before anyone was hurt yawnbras for drinking on the job in my years in govt service ive seen plenty of drinking drug abuse or just plain old puttingin8hoursanddoing nothingbr thats one of the reasons civil service employees can not be fired no matter what they do look into the ira practices brnot that there is anything right with that
1647,sounds like he also needs to resign and be dishonorably discharged  
1648,i can think of 239 likely more like 259 reasons to withdraw starting with having to interact with trump and be humilated by his nonsense
1649,trump only hires the finest people apparently his personal doctor is not one of them
1650,naturally trump blames democrats even after acknowledging his nominee is in serious trouble do we wonder why the country is so polarized mr witch hunt strikes again 
1651,might withdrawbrbrthat will save trump having to admit he didnt vet the guy at allbrbrgood grief
1652,if this doesnt work out who will the president nominate next my bets are on dr zhivago or captain crunch 
1653,hes not qualified period frankly he should have told the president that himself 
1654,oh darn  i really wanted to hear him testify under oath about the cognitive test he administered
1655,extreme vetting is reserved for those wanting to enter our country due to persecution or the dangers of warfare  no vetting at all is what is reserved for those who want to be in charge of the affairs of our battle weary and scarred fighting forces  classic trump
1656,this edition of the best and brightest played to trumps inflated ego  nothing more nothing less  kiss it goodbye
1657,every practicing physicians office has people to take care of the billing and administrative part of the business and here is ronny a physician in charge of veterans affairs department a federal department an administrative department involving real lives obviously a very wrong choice and an inebriated one too besides he should be sued for malpractice and his license to practice revoked overprescribing drugs is a felonybrwhich nominee of trump is right for the department he heads none and the common thread for all nominations is cronyism a sick adulation for a narcissistic president
1658,     im concerned that the author was too aggressive in terms of how she interpreted her results  its true that she finds measures of economic hardship to be uncorrelated with trump votes  two things complicate the interpretation of status as being more important than economic hardshipbr     first people often answer surveys in ways that preserve their selfesteem  this is especially true on surveys of peoples financial conditions  in the 2017 retirement confidence survey by the employee benefit research institute 79 of people reported feeling very or somewhat confident about their ability to have enough money for a comfortable retirement  yet a recent study by fidelity found that half of americans may not be able to cover basic living costs in retirement  thus people tend to provide selfserving answers to questions about personal financesbr     second the measures of status threat could simply be proxying for economic hardships  if people are show selfserving bias they are likely to blame external forces like china trade and immigration for their own economic hardships  the author doesnt explore this possibility either in the paper or in the supplemental materials  the relationship between the status threat variables and the economic hardship variables is undoubtedly complex and needs more attention before it can be concluded that economic hardship doesnt matter 
1659,i know for a fact that if i had to say the president was fit for duty i would drink on the job for that i cant blame him
1660,havent been following this as closely as i should have was barely aware that jackson was rumored to have overseen a hostile work environment whatever that means and not at all aware of rumors of excessive drink in a doctor ministering to a presidentbrbrtrumps people need to vet nominees a lot more carefully than they have the optics here arent good  and the substance if the rumors are proved is even worse
1661,at least a handful of republicans are standing up to trumps bad decisions its about time and about time that more republicans realize trump shouldnt be making major decisions
1662,for trump appointees drinking too much on the job is a definite plus and should be taken as a strong recommendation
1663,perhaps dr ronny would be better suited as house doctor at trumps mar a largo resort where more than likely anything goes knowing trump i suspect that stds might be a major medical concern there 
1664,that is what flattering trump gets you  a promise of a high position and then complete humiliationbrtoo bad the senate confirmations of past nominees who were approved wasnt more thorough  if they had been the cabinet members that they voted in the affirmative for would never have been given the posts they werebrmost of them have continued to put their own interests first instead of the countriesbrhopefully mr jackson withdrawers his nomination before he is further embarrassed
1665,yet again this is the best trump can come up with certainly jackson might be a great doctor but the position doesnt need one it requires an administrator and advocate this nomination reminds me of the time president bush named his white house lawyer to the supreme court there was rightful outrage then because while she met the minimum requirement of being a lawyer it certainly takes more than that to be on the supreme court there is plenty of blame to go around  to trump for nominating people who are supremely under qualified and the republicans for rolling over and giving them a pass 
1666,my guess is that not only will he not be a cabinet secretary he wont even be a government employee much longer
1667,the more i read about dr ronny jackson the more i am impressed america is in dire need of men with his capabilities i urge his confirmation thank you
1668,i wonder if rachel maddow can add captain crunchs name to her board of firedresigned trump conconspirators technically because he was not confirmed before he was fired andor resigned  tricky question
1669,the guy was nominated on the basis of being good looking and having composure in front of the camera when telling bold faced lies about trumps health oh and hes a veteran so that really qualifies him to run the va brbranother day in the notnormal united states of america
1670,the main issue facing the va is how much to expand the choice program or privatization we dont know where dr jackson stands on this critical issue outsourcing care to insurance companies needs to be closely monitored and evaluatedbr also a huge risk to the va is a diminished effort to hire the best doctors and nurses so the care provided is at least equal and preferably better than what is offered in the private sector whoever is selected to head the va should be aware of the critical decisions to be faced and the overall impact on veterans health care 
1671,my rx for this nominationbrbrtake two tablets of extreme vetting then call it off in the morning
1672,if this nominee does not work out who will suffer  this is a gamble that does not look like it is going to be for the benefit of our veterans   
1673,i am a vietnam veteran and tried to drink my war memoirs away it looks like admiral ronny may be on that downward slope he needs medical care and consultation if he is drinking on the job the va is a wonderful care giving hospital and would welcome admiral ronny with open arms trump has inadvertently helped admiral ronny and had no idea he did 
1674,lots of irony here  trump acted on impulse to nominate ronny jackson without properly vetting him  trump tweet fired dr david shulkin our david never to hear youre fired dr shulkin had the requisite skills and experience to manage a large bureaucracy like the va  obama nominated him and the senate confirmed him 1000  trump is a teetotaler  dr jackson apparently indulges on the job  brbr trump churns through appointees like a paper shredder   appointees must demonstrate loyalty to him personally and not steal the spotlight from the boss  the list of those fired or resigned grows ever longer 
1675,so much winning yes we are getting tired of all this winning
1676,the trump administration should just outsource all hiring decisions including vetting to the kremlinbrbrclearly the kremlin can do a better job at vetting candidates than this administration
1677,another nominee not vetted properly slimed by the very man who nominated him cheeseball president strikes again the afterthought hes a good man but
1678,jacksons key qualification is that he panders to the preseg trump is in great physical shape and has excellent mental capacities etcbrbrthats all that trump really cares about 
1679,just when you thought this administration couldnt sink any lower  i doubt well hear a peep from all those republicans who put an i support the troops decal on the cars since thats the extent of their support for the troops  among that selfish greedy crowd supper for the 
1680,obstruction those dems cannot come to my goldplated party   jacksons special really good man good family special in every very very special way  
1681,i imagine the post of physician in the white house is a bit of a non job the sort where you shunt an affable and reasonably competent guy who isnt going to kill anyone by accident but someone who is patently not a high flyer also given the fact he has been there for 12 years should tell us something about his career trajectory 
1682,another trump appointee will bite the dust if not this afternoon   after trump praised him and gave him his ticket to ride during his press conference just now with president macron   then soon the president again nailed the democrats as obstructionists during macrons and his love and kissy fest does trump have no inkling of the draconian gop obstructionism of our house and senate during president obamas entire two terms in office from 2008 to 2016 tis pity and shameful that trump doesnt know diddly about american history and english grammar it is apparent from his remarks crafted by some gen x speechwriter in the white house that trump can still read  but not so good folks
1683,    trumps inept choice of a candidate based on his capricious and ignorant whims and ignoring any study about previous records allows for the humiliation in public of himself and of an inept individual to a job far too big for him as is the presidency for trump by the way in addition to the abuse of his office as reported this is planned chaos a product of the stupidity of our ugly american inchief as it will prove to be with bolton and as it was with pruitt and his ilk this is harmful and aberrant behavior not the new normal at least it shouldnt
1684,he drank too much on the job as opposed to just plain drinking on the job not okay 
1685,my favorite conspiracy theory is the very white house secretly on someones payroll to force the gop into the dust bin of history  dr ronny jackson is just the latest example 
1686,they have also received claims that dr ronny l jackson drank too much on the jobbrbrummmmmm how much is too much drinking on the job in the white house
1687,from the article jackson drank too much on the jobbrbra minimum required level of alcohol consumption required for this job should not surprise anyone with a minimum sense of propriety  another day  another milestone in trumpian exceptionalism  mada  
1688,if i drank at work  firedbrif i exaggerated and covered up the truth to gain personal favour  firedbrcreate hostile atmosphere  firedbrbrthis nomination is another absolute joke by this white house
1689,just watchintrumper press conf w president macronhe was asked a question about dr jacksonthe trumper said hes one the the finest people he trump has ever met  give me a break    the trumper has known dr jackson for a little over a yearnot like they are longtime friends   doesnt take much to a one of the finest people hes ever met   if i were dr jackson id step aside   another example of inadequate or non existent vetting by this administration   they cant find anyone half way qualified who want jobs in the administration so they just randomly pick folks that the trumper likes   sad sad sad   dr j shoulda turned it down from the beginning
1690,government by the whim of an ignorant and thoughtless president dr jacksons good looks and effusive praise of our emotionally deficient  leader did the trick no vetting no thought just pure emotion what could possibly go wrong
1691,another incompetent professional hiding in the military with a high rank im sure there are plenty of very competent people that choose a military career but they seem to be in the minority seems like the upper ranks of the military are a sanctuary for the incompetent
1692,so many red flags drinks too much on the job read this line again and remember his job is a physician who is he overprescribing to remember his job is a physician the white house physician he should lose his current job and seek treatment 
1693,this guy will fit right in with pruitt and sessions and the rest in the cabinet 
1694,allowed the overprescribing of drugs  to whom
1695,well at least it is not sexual harassment  there is that
1696,what do you call the guy who graduates last in their class in medical school unfortunately you call him doctor ronny jackson
1697,trump and the other chickenhawks of the gophonor our troops until they require expenditures of time money and talentand then shortchange them
1698,what about trumps personal new york physician dr harold bornstein who told us that trump would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency maybe he would be available for the va job just saying
1699,i think the so called drbrwas drunk when he announced 45 was in excellent health
1700,isnt it possible that jackson jumped at the va nomination because he realized that the navy had decided to park him in a dead end job
1701,he is apparently a reasonable doc but is also an obvious political tyro and hackbrbrhe has no business being elevated to this terribly important postbrbrhe will be an unmitigated disaster
1702,no surprise here he now has to scrape the bottom of the barrel as no decent person wants to be associated with him
1703,wait a minute or should i say 9 years  was he not the white house physician during the last part of the bush white house and all of the obama administration  was he just a minor physician or the chief physician  was he hitting the bottle during this period  and who was he overprescribing drugs to  perhaps thats why obama was so calm  surely the good doctor had a few when he proclaimed that trump could live to 200 given his genes if it were not for his diet  look the first blush of comments on his nomination had a similar refrainbest guy to have around did something change
1704,an editorial quibble jackson drank too much on the job implies that theres an acceptable amount of drinking on the job and he merely exceeded it other than a bourbon taster or don draper throwback i cant think of a job  especially not one held by a doctor  where drinking any amount is an acceptable norm 
1705,how long before the inept become the pitiful
1706,heres another case of the trump team and gop leadership teeing up crucial government agency the v a or public land for management or sale to the highest bidder aka privatization  brbrand privatization has been well documented and proven to mainly benefit the commercial entities not the prisoners veterans students national parks patrons us citizens whichever the case may bebrbrin other words letting dr ronny jackson run the va will be as successful as the odds of a graduate from trump u getting hired to run a major corporation  brbrlets see if any gop leaders have sufficient spine to shoot dr j down  since they all profess to care so deeply about our veterans  brbras mr rogers would say can you spell h y p o c r i t e s
1707,allegations again this is really another attempt to derail the presidents administration if jackson was doing anything improper especially with the prescriptions the us secret service would have stepped it  if a professional hospital manager couldnt run the va maybe its time to try something else nonsense comment from senator blumenthal the same blumenthal  who stated he served in vietnam sorry was only a vietnam era veteran we all know that mcconnell  a card carrying member of the swampwill secretly do everything to  derail president trump
1708,hey if the senate confirmed devos they will likely confirm jackson  both are equally unqualified to run anything in our government
1709,good grief when will people realize that when they get close to trump andor accept a position in his administration they are going to attract attention to their er faults and eventually be humiliated at best and jailed at worst yet this seems to continuously happen how stupid can people be 
1710,any drinking on the job is wrong  i served 24 years  in the air force and never drank alcohol on the job i would have faced immediate discharge if i had done so did others drink on the job  i knew a couple of people who did they were discharged or invited to retire if eligible and sometimes punished before discharge or retirement brbrsay goodbye now admiral youve lost any respect you might have had if youve actually been drinking on the job you dont deserve your rank or retirement pay 
1711,i am wondering if he was drinking when he gave trump a physical and mental examination and proclaimed he could live to be 200
1712,thank you senator blumenthal for speaking out again on the correct side of another important issue brbrim behind on the news has trump tweeted about you yet perhaps thought up some clever insulting nickname for youbrbrdont worry about it when it happensits become a medal of integrity these days 
1713,ao the investigation began a week ago about the time he was nominated who made the allegations he has worked for 3 presidents with no problems but suddenly now when trump nominates him there are allegations i am guessing it ia the dems doing it again to stir up trouble before the 2018 elections otherwise why the secrecy on where the allegations came from 
1714,the mother most significant doctoring that ronny jackson has done was his report on trumps fabulous good health
1715,essay topic they have also received claims that dr ronny l jackson drank too much on the jobbrwhat exactly constitutes drinking too much when youre the white house physician this is a trickier question than it might seem on the surface in your response consider the nature of the primary patient and the overall state of morale in the place of practice also is drinking alone less acceptable than imbibing with workmates 30 points
1716,why werent these issues raised when dr jackson was obamas doctor  i suspect that these criticisms are a political hit job
1717,perhaps someone could help me here   for my  next book  i am compiling a list of careers that allow drinking on the job   so far i have wine taster whiskey taster physician   no wait wine tasters and whiskey tasters spit the drink out after tasting
1718,quite a remarkable record dr jackson has achieved   add to that his total lack of administrative experienceand we have another amateur trump wants to head up an important agency    all in a days pratfalls for this administration
1719,winning so much winning i cant stand it  
1720,one wonders if perhaps dr jackson was drinking too much on the job when he conducted the presidents physical in january it might also explain the i love you bro effusiveness of his announcement about the results
1721,many of us here in georgia were completely shocked when at 600 pm on 4162018 senator isakson called a telephone townhall with his constituents that was not on his website the first thing he said was he just came from his first meeting with dr jackson who was starting the preliminary rounds of the confirmation process he made it very very clear that he was happy with the leadership of dr shulkin he was very disappointed with how dr shulkin was fired he felt that dr shulkin had made huge improvements with the va that the va needed an experienced md who was a hospital administrator like dr shulkin was  he also was clear that the va made a contract with veterans and privatizing the va did not meet that contract with the veterans who faught our wars under his watch he was not going to allow the va to be privatized 
1722,not to be off topic as many of the comments are spot on  however has anyone but me noticed that when a a congressional republican or b anyone from trumps administration is put on the spot with a question they dont like or they are hiding truthful information their lips disappear  look at dr jacksons facerecently have seen the same face on nunes romney ryan mcconnell pencethe list goes on and on  thats some body language therephysically trying to keep the lies in
1723,januarys physical exam conversation brjackson  now sir what is the first letter of your first namebrtrumpety  er sings the abc song in his head  er dbrjackson excellent mr president perfect cognitive skillsbrjackson now sir can you stand up from the chairbrtrumpety stands upbrjackson excellent mr president excellent physical shapebrthats it  you are in excellent shape
1724,im more concerned that the new va wont extend benefits to former pows captain bone spurs doesnt like people who got captured
1725,im trying to fathom how in the world the president of the united states has a doctor who drinks on the job how is this possible how is anything about this president possible i realize the good doc was also obamas doc how is that possible i can understand trump having a sot for a doc but not obama trump might actually prefer a drunk doc who would ignore the reality of his patient just as the patient ignores the reality of the world as we know it its a world where people are chosen for their competence and their pathos for their excellent qualifications and their desire to perform the job they are being hired for trump is wired in reverse he will short circuit 
1726,any man who can gush so shamelessly and lie so knowingly about the presidents health is not to be trusted its as simple as that
1727,brlets see  when i was in college i took and did pretty darn well in a lot of biology chemistry human physiology stats and business classes  i have a brother who was a combat medic and three cousins who fought in nam and i do not drink  heck  i think i could be considered more qualified with better credentials than dr ronny  just saying  brbrsadly this senate veterans affairs committee situation is extremely serious and loaded with literally life and death consequences  i apologize if my smarty pants post offended anyone or appeared disrespectful  
1728,i would really like to see a list of top people nominated by trump who are not egregiousbehaving scoundrelsbrbrif such a list can be generated
1729,where does he find these people one after another after another so far hes hit a home run of creepiness every time at batbrbrhard to believe but here we are  
1730,when appointees and cabinet members are chosen the same way strangers get chosen to play on opposing teams in a pickup basketball game at a neighborhood court this is what you get trump keeps picking people who cant jump any better than he can the big orange will keep doing it though because hes immune to feeling embarrassed by some of the allbutclownsuited stumblebums whove made him a laughingstock  price priebus flynn spicer scaramucci bannon newman mcentee higbee carson pruitt sorensen and porter wifeabusers
1731,amazing how in the sycophantic progressivesocialist media all supporters of elite status are saints evidence to the contrary but all honorable opposition should be pilloried and punished without trial or rebuttalbrbrjakob smirnoff russian comic actor said it best what a country
1732,i personally thought that dr ronny jackson  during the conference about trumps state of health  appeared disengaged from normal mental behavior for a serious physician  his remarks were weird  totally unprofessional  and non realistic i was definitely appalled by his performance
1733,just curious if he might have been drinking when he issued the report on trumps health  it certainly would explain a lotbrbralso i wonder what drugs hes accused of allowing to be overprescribed  the delicious irony it they turn out to be opioids  
1734,brhmm  a va nominee who allegedly allowed the overprescribing of drugs oversaw a hostile work environment as the white house physician and claims that dr ronny l jackson drank too much on the job suggesting a pattern of behavior not just one or two isolated incidentsbrbri guess these alleged red flags are meaningless and just behavioral quirks in the eyes of our hollow head leader and perhaps even the senate should they decide to approve this appointment  apparently no one on the senate committee has read how messed up the va is  putting this individual in charge could not only make matters worse but actually dismantle the va completely  oh yeah dr jackson is a real ringer for the job
1735,what white house submits poorly qualified candidate for senior post without vetting say it aint so joe
1736,drinking at work  now we understand how donald got such a rave review of his physical from the good dr
1737,i have the best people only the best people winning again only the best people the best people only 
1738,as ronnys white house toddies indicate  among many other signs  mad men has not ceased production but merely moved the set 
1739,given the incompetence of the average trump nominee we need to realize that it is not paranoia but common sense guiding suspicions that he is working in collusion with russians to destroy our government
1740,excessive drinking on the job  white house physicians are allowed to drink on the job  military physicians are allowed to drink on the job
1741,presumably the pharma industry would love to have a doctor given to overprescription heading the va
1742,hes been the the presidents physician since 2006 so did he start drinking on the job only since president trump took officebrbrwerent there any issues earlier he must have been issuing health certificates for presidents bush and obama toobrbrwhats going on
1743,no one seems to be commenting on the overprescription aspect of these allegations  are we about to find out about a whole new scandal with trump and  nasal decongestants  that would really take the cake  
1744,seriously no should we be surprised by the claims raised concerning trumps nominee this just provides news organizations  liberal conservative and otherwise  more to babble about trump loves to throw raw meat to the hungry lions and what them fight over it theres method to his madness it keeps his detractors emotionally off balance while trump goes about the business of executing his agenda 
1745,this guy has been the wh physician since 2013  i doubt the over indulging in alcohol over prescribing of drugs and the hostile work environment only happened recently  were there previous reports that were ignored or fell on deaf ears  his drinking potentially put the health of the president including obama at risk  he should be dismissed immediately  and lose his military benefits  
1746,drinking would explain his post trump medical press conference where trump mysteriously grew an inch jackson obviously had a defective scale or his eyes were blurry when he read it and superlatives were embarrassing
1747,dr jackson served in combat the deadly part is superfluous and apparently did his job for which we thank and praise him he became an admiral by virtue of the rules and chain of command and by keeping his head down thems the rules and his rank implies that he is basically competent and knows the right people and says the right things and has longevity these are not indicia of being among the best and brightest as we were promised i am not surprised that there are allegations  the entire white house staff seems  riddled with the overindulgent the corrupt and the craven poor man he should have stayed undercover and wended his peaceful way to retirement as he is not qualified to head the va and now his character flaws are going to come out for full display and discussion his retirement may well be gone with the wind 
1748,one question i do have if hes as bad as many of us assumed after his press conference on trump and if these allegations are true all of that conflicts with him also being a physician for past presidents something doesnt add up did he develop a new problem after prior administrations did other administrations not notice is this a political tactic now im no trump supporter but something doesnt add up here 
1749,reports are that ronny jackson has one other patient besides trump but doesnt want to name that person to avoid embarrassment it is not clear who would be embarrassed the patient or jackson nor is it clear for what medical or mental condition jackson is treating the second person the second patient is claiming doctorpatient privilege prevents his identification being made publicbrbrin other developments fox news nonnewsman sean hannity said devil liberals are attempting to close the veterans administration by blocking jacksons appointmentbrbrevangelical leaders stood in robes behind hannity chorusing that it was the only way to prevent devil liberals from opening abortion clinics in every junior high school in the nation
1750,whats the problem its already a well known fact that possibly the worstpresidentever is only capable of picking the worstcandidatesever to fill any availabel post just because there friendsbrclearly having the right qualifications for the job doesnt mean what it used to
1751,overseeing a hostile work environment  sounds perfectly will qualified for a job in or around the trump administration
1752,trump continues to run the government as though he was simply the head of trump enterprises appoint on wim reward your friends fire those who will not pledge mindless loyalty will this ever change i think not loyalty will always trump competence this will not make america greater
1753,any physician who says ive found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes is clearly not meant to oversee the vabrbrnext contestant 
1754,trumps extreme vetting program was supposed to have been completed 90 days after he took office
1755,if dr jackson ignored the high cholesterol in his report saying trump was in excellent health that would seem to call into question other facets of his report 
1756,aw cmon  cant the trump cabinet have two medical doctors clearly unqualified to run large government organizations
1757,keep pounding them down ronny trump is in the hospitality business he makes a lot of money selling tax deductible business entertainment rooms  adult beverages fine dining and ancillary legal and illegal personal services it is only natural to kiss up to the boss a few at business meetings at a time at fine trump owned hotels it is just a tip for the boss to keep your job
1758,im kind of weary of snappy jokes about trumps horridly wrong appointments to the departments that run our country when is the congress really going to stand up to this nonsense 
1759,i shouldnt imply that its but one of myriad factors but allegations that dr jackson overprescribed drugs revives suspicions about trumps erratic behavior   
1760,he massaged donalds egothus he is qualified
1761,overprescriptionbrbrreallybrbrthat could explain a lot dont you think
1762,whether he drinks too much is the least of our worries he is totally unqualified to manage a huge and complicated agency he has  zero experience  
1763,if trump picked him he is probably not qualified
1764,why should it be surprising that a man who publicly lied for trump would do these other things as well i would have been very surprised had a thorough look into his background not have uncovered multiple problems
1765,just as a matter of interest what would be considered just the right amount of drinking to do on the job
1766,drank too much on the job everywhere ive ever worked drinking any alcohol on the job was too much brbrsounds like hes completely unqualified little surprise for a trump nominee
1767,to me fact that radm jackson accepted this inevitably humiliating and potentially careerending nomination speaks more to his limited intelligence than any other fact in the case  i also have trouble believing that even trump thought he was qualified or confirmable  the base is divided on outsourcing care for vets and my suspicion is that no one in the white house sees any political gain in taking the va seriously
1768,a faulty and flawed president pickeing flawed and faulty nominees for his cabinet
1769,overseeing a hostile work environment checkbraccusations of drunkness and licentious leanings  checkbrbeing asked to be in charge of public health while overprescribing dangerous drugs aka doing the exact opposite of what the job requires checkbrbrding ding ding we have another swamp master welcome to djts america where the best qualifications are a general leaning toward depravity ineptitude arrogance and criminality brbrthe rest of us have not just a right but an obligation to reject these nominations and picks no one deserves this level of chaos  not even those who voted in this cretinous thundering fool 
1770,hello earth to new york times readersbrbrhe has been a white house physician since 2006 first appointed to the role of physician to the president on july 25 2013 by barack obamabrbrthese comments are hilarious floating logs in the trump toilet really maybe if the article had contained the information on how this guy came to be where he is we could avoided the nonsense in this comments section 
1771,hes obviously incompetent as a doctor so there is little reason to think he would be competent as an administrator but he has not experience is a trump sycophant and is obviously a liar so hes definitely perfect for the trump team 
1772,drinks too much on the job  are you baiting the commenters  or do the editors and reporters at the times drink on the job and need to distinguish that habit from drinking too much on the jobbrbrheres some news  i work two jobs and im paid to the tune of qualifying  for an assortment of government assistance and here in my world there is no drinking on the job period brbrim getting sick of hearing about rich peoples slimy ways from other rich people 
1773,they have also received claims that dr ronny l jackson drank too much on the job hmmmm wonder how much is too much wouldnt that be any amount especially if youre a physician
1774,i would expect no less from traitor trumps physician who better than ronny to take care of a sociopath
1775,yet another incompetent dishonest agency destroyer who probably made a deal with trump giving trump a clean bill of health in exchange for the va post naturally the equally corrupt republicans in congress will roll over yet again for this disgraceful appointment
1776,trump is insulting all us veterans  with this appointment  he spits on everything this country has fought and died for and his republican stooges go right along with it  throw them all out
1777,cant blame jackson for drinking in the white house
1778,in other words trump dumped the previous competent guy for a stupid mistake equal to maybe five percent of what scott pruitts been up to shot his mouth off about adm jackson without doing the slightest homework or asking anybody else to and is nowonce againin the process of letting somebody twist in the wind while he figures out his alibibrbrprovided he even remembers who jackson is or that theres a va brbrboy really makes you want to go to war with this clown as commander in chief dont it 
1779,he also has no experience in this field how can republicans let their idiot of a president appoint someone who has no experience in this complex field after years of work to get the va straightened out brbrit just boggles the mind 
1780,what  you mean the guy that proclaimed that donald trump is in excellent help shouldnt be trusted  the guy who proclaimed that trump only weighs 139 pounds hahalol will live to be 200 years old if he only exercised a tad bit due to his superior genesbrbrlike everyone else trump touches this guys career will end with him being a laughing stockbrdr jackson whatever trump promised you for delivering that ridiculous press conference it wasnt worth it  just ask sean spicer
1781,at one point he even quipped that given mr trumps genetics he might live to 200 years old if he had a healthier diet who could have thought that this doctor might not be a genius
1782,the fundamental problem with almost all of the people that 45 seems to pick for top jobs is that they have no credentials and are hopelessly unqualified for the positions he selects them for  a minimum of vetting would probably help but perhaps not because he ran on an anti government anti intellectual platform but for goodness sake the least he could do is appoint qualified people even if theyre not washington insiders  
1783,i have no ethics im a veteran i have no great experience for any government position looks like im next in line for a staff position in the white house i suppose 
1784,well he sounds like a typical appointee for this so called administrationbrevery time we think theyve scraped the bottom of the barrel we realize that the bottom was even deeper than wed thoughtbrbrand either he was high or drunk perhaps both when he wrote the report and gave that press conference about the fake presidents health or hed already been promised the job in exchange for the report
1785,its not surprising that trump didnt vet this guy sufficiently or in the alternative its not surprising that trump knew these things and saw nothing wrong 
1786,a personronny jackson with limited manage experience disastrous in a small setting and drinking on the job is being set up to run one of the largest government heath departments  trumps private cronies are waiting in the wings to privatize the va for profitbrthough we think that trumps choice is only poorly chosen candidate ronny jackson is part of trumps shoot from the hip populism it is part of trumps larger plan to allow these intuitions to fail so they can be rescued by the private sector this privatization did not work for the prison system and it does not save the taxpayers any moneybrit only allows the capitalist vultures to profit
1787,we cannot hand the jewel of veteran health care with hundreds and thousands of employees to a man chosen because of personal affinity a man with no administrative experience  it defies common sense 
1788,the only reason trump chose dr jackson to lead the va is that he was loyal and did as he was told  jackson said that trump had superior genes lied about trumps weight and height and said that could live to be 200 years old which is ridiculous for anyone to say let alone a doctorbrbrtrump has been reckless in vetting people for important jobs this is just another example of how unfit he is to be the president
1789,drank too much on the job  as a military flag officer  thats one of the inadvertently funniest lines ive seen in the nyt of latebrbrreally the guy is good perhaps a great or even brilliant doctor  almost utterly irrelevant to setting and administering health care policy for millions and running a bureaucracy of the size and inflexibility as the va  his nomination is the same old baldfaced personalistic politics that got us flynn for a time kushner a 30 year old real estate developer running middle east peace talks  really and so many of the inept crowd leading our country  now i gotta go back to crying in my beer  just not at work
1790,of all the theories in attempting to explain the bizarre report by admiral jackson on the health of djt  i dont remember anyone suggesting that he might have had too much to drink  or perhaps he prescribed himself some happy pills that enabled him to ignore reality and do what so many entertainers do to get through a performancebrhow much more damage could another bad appointment do  how could jackson not recognize his lack of qualifications  he seems personable enough but that could be said about most of the population  the only qualification for trump is the ability to glorify djt in prolonged effusive praise leaving everyone struck dumbfounded by the irony and stunned in disbelief
1791,its obvious whats going on with jacksons nomination its yet another demonstration of trumps preference for loyalty over qualifications a reward for the extremely optimistic report on trumps healthbrbrthere are probably a half million people on the east coast alone who are more qualified than this guy but since trump doesnt know if theyre loyal to him  in other words willing to say hell live to 200  they dont qualify in trumps mind following the trump line of thought who cares if he has a drink or two on the job his only real job is to tow the line and protect his bossbrbrit may also be intended to set an example its a way of saying hey if you praise me and bolster me ill give you a fat reward look what i did for the doc who said my genes are great perhaps trump has realized this may be the only way he can lure anyone into a white house job these days
1792,this is what you get when the only vetting process is basically how good you are at pleasing the boss  
1793,this accusation of drinking too much on the job strikes the same nerve in me as volkswagen trying to become more lawabidingbrbrwhatever happened to dont drink at work and obey the laws 
1794,as a teacher i wonder if i would ever be accused of too much drinking the ladies and gentlemen i work with are constantly considering how things look to others when it concerns our behavior appearances are everything in my career i guess this doesnt apply to admirals that take care of the president for some reason wasnt he vetted for that position let alone as the va boss brbrnow trump has fired a very competent individual to put in his place admiral doctor feelgood who likes a nip on the job now and again is that too much 
1795,the other interesting thing about these revelations is that dr jackson accepted the nomination knowing that he had these problems in his background  had he been assured that nobody would find out
1796,knives are out to cut down the knight in shinning armor well let us whether the allegations have any merit there are always will be disgruntled employees in any work environment who will complain that working is not like a picnic
1797,trumps idea of vetting candidates for offices is decidedly different than what we might expectbrbrjackson told the world that trump is in excellent health multiple times while at the same time lied to the world about trumps height  he grew an inch by jacksons reckoning  to keep trump out of the obese category  trump takes cholesterol pills  moreover trump is so badly out of shape that at the g7 conference in sicily trump had to ride in a golf cart rather than walk with the other world leadersbrbrit is all about loyalty  willingness to lie and cheat to support the president is what qualifies a man for a trump position  never mind management qualifications  
1798,brif dr ronny l jackson is indeed confirmed to run the veterans affairs department the only glimmer of hope i would have is that he would be gone albeit dismissed fired resigned etc within a year two at the most after his appointment since most of trumps best of the best have gone by the wayside in a similar time period  right now hope is all i have because the alternative is too dim and depressing to ponder over
1799,its no surprise that trump continues to select questionable candidates for important jobs  what really baffles me is how do characters like dr jackson and michael flynn get promoted to such high ranks in our military
